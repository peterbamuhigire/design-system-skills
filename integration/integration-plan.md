# Integration Plan — design-system-skills

How the domain engines connect to this one, and the log of design skills migrated in.

**Model: reference, not mirror.** Nothing is copied into the domain engines. Each one gets a
single trigger block pointing here, and design skills are *moved out* of the domain engines
into this repo (lowering their skill counts). This engine is cloned on every device so the
reference always resolves.

---

## 1. The trigger block (paste into each engine's CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md)

Add this to the routing/engine-table section of each consumer engine. Adapt the relative path
if the engine lives elsewhere on a given device.

```markdown
### Design / typography / UI (cross-cutting — consult IN ADDITION)

Any work touching how an artifact LOOKS — font choice, type scale, colour, layout/grid, visual
identity, web/desktop/mobile UI screens, or the visual formatting of a DOCX/PPTX/PDF/XLSX —
routes to the **design-system-skills** engine at `C:\wamp64\www\design-system-skills`.
Start at its `README.md`, then read `doctrine/design-doctrine.md`, then glob
`skills/**/SKILL.md`. Read the SKILL.md files directly (not via the Skill tool). Content and
structure stay in this engine; presentation comes from design-system-skills. Hard rule: never
use a banned AI-slop font (Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, Lato, bare system stacks; nor the
escapes Space Grotesk, Poppins, Montserrat, Nunito, standalone Source Sans) — state the chosen
typeface and reason before producing any artifact.
```

### Consumer engines (where the block goes)

| Engine | Path | Block added? |
|---|---|---|
| business-plan-skills | `C:\wamp64\www\business-plan-skills` | pending |
| srs-skills | `C:\wamp64\www\srs-skills` | pending |
| proposal-skills | `C:\wamp64\www\proposal-skills` | pending |
| website-skills | `C:\wamp64\www\website-skills` | pending |
| social-media-skills | `C:\wamp64\www\social-media-skills` | pending |
| engineering-catalog (`~/.claude/skills`) | `C:\Users\Peter\.claude\skills` | pending |
| digital-research-engine | `C:\Users\Peter\Documents\Claude Projects\digital-research-engine` | pending |

> The user's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` engine-routing table should also gain a row for
> design-system-skills as a cross-cutting engine (alongside the finance engine note).

## 2. Migration log (design skills moved INTO this engine)

Populated after the read-only migration-candidate scan is approved. **No skill is moved until
the manifest below is approved and the source engine is `git pull`-ed.** Blended skills (content
+ styling) are SPLIT — content stays in the domain engine, styling extracts here — not moved
wholesale.

| Source engine | Source skill (path) | Disposition (move / split / leave) | Destination group here | Done? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(to be filled by the candidate scan)_ | | | | |

### Migration safety rules

1. `git pull --ff-only` the source engine immediately before touching it.
2. Show the full manifest and get explicit approval before any move/delete (never-destructive rule).
3. Move with history where practical; otherwise copy-then-remove in a reviewed commit.
4. For each move, leave a one-line pointer/stub in the source engine's router noting the skill
   now lives in design-system-skills (so old references resolve).
5. Update this log and the source engine's skill count after each batch.
