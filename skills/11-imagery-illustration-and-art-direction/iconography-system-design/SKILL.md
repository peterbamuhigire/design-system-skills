description: Use when designing or auditing a custom icon set / icon system — choosing the icon grid (e.g. 24px live area on a 24px artboard with keylines), the stroke weight and how it stays constant across sizes, the corner-radius and terminal language, the metaphor rules that keep glyphs consistent and unambiguous, optical-balance corrections (visual vs mathematical centering, square/circle/triangle area compensation), pixel-fitting/hinting at small sizes, and the rules for exporting an SVG sprite/font with a stable naming taxonomy. Routes here for "design an icon set", "icon grid", "icon stroke weight", "keyline shapes", "optical alignment of icons", "icon metaphor consistency", "icon spec sheet", "make our icons feel like one family", "custom iconography", "icon naming/taxonomy". Treats icons as a typographic-grade system, not clip-art picked one at a time.

# Iconography System Design

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When
- Designing a **custom icon set** from scratch, or replacing a grab-bag of mismatched icons with one coherent family.
- Defining the **construction grid** for icons: artboard, live area, padding/keyline, and the keyline shapes (square / circle / rectangle / portrait) that govern how each glyph is sized.
- Setting the **stroke system** — nominal stroke weight, how it stays optically constant across sizes and across solid vs outline styles, corner radius, terminal/cap and join language.
- Enforcing **metaphor consistency** — that the same concept always uses the same glyph, that perspective/angle/fill are uniform, and that no two icons read as the same thing.
- Correcting **optical balance** — visual (not mathematical) centering, area compensation so a circle, square, and triangle of the same bounding box feel equal weight, and stem alignment.
- **Pixel-fitting** icons for small UI sizes (16/20/24px) and writing **export + naming** rules for an SVG sprite or icon font.
- Auditing an existing set for the slop signature: borrowed-from-three-libraries inconsistency, mixed stroke weights, off-grid glyphs.

## Do Not Use When
- You are directing **photography or AI-generated imagery** (style, treatment, cropping, sourcing). Use `photography-art-direction`.
- You are choosing **brand colors or building the palette** the icons are tinted with. Use `color-system-and-palette` / `accessible-color-and-contrast`; this skill keeps icons monochrome-by-default and inherits color via `currentColor`.
- You are specifying the **component** that *contains* an icon (Button with leading icon, IconButton states/target-size). Use `component-library-architecture`; this skill defines the glyph, that one defines the control around it.
- You only need **one quick glyph** and a consistent system is not the goal — though even then, match the existing grid/stroke rather than introducing a foreign icon.
- You are designing **spot illustrations or larger decorative art**. Iconography is functional, reductive, and grid-bound; illustration is not.

## Required Inputs
- The **target rendering sizes** (e.g. 16, 20, 24px in UI; 24px as the design base) — this fixes the grid and the stroke weight, because stroke and grid are size-relative.
- The **style intent**: outline (stroked) vs solid (filled) vs duotone, and the brand's character (geometric/precise, humanist/friendly, sharp/technical). State this before drawing — per `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §2, the choice is named first.
- The **inventory** — the concrete list of concepts that need glyphs (not "some icons"), so metaphors can be deconflicted as a set.
- A **type/grid context** — the icon stroke should relate to the UI's text weight and the spacing scale (`doctrine/references/type-scale-and-spacing.md`), so icons sit on the same rhythm as everything else.

## Workflow
1. **State the style choice before drawing a single glyph** (`doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §2 non-negotiable #1). Name it: e.g. *"2px outline, round join, round cap, 2px corner radius, geometric — on a 24px grid."* The default-looking icon set (1.5px generic outline, the exact Material/Feather silhouette everyone ships) is the convergent AI mean; the authored choice is what makes the set read as one skilled hand. Pick the *one* signature move (a distinctive corner radius, a consistent open-terminal, a 45°-only diagonal rule) and apply it to every glyph.
2. **Define the grid: artboard, live area, padding, keylines.** Standard base is a **24×24px artboard** with a **~2px outer padding → 20×20 live area** (some systems use 22px live area / 1px trim; state which). Inside the live area place **keyline shapes**: a square (e.g. 18×18), a circle (e.g. 20Ø), a horizontal rectangle (20×16), and a portrait rectangle (16×20). Every glyph is sized to **one** keyline so a circular icon (clock) and a square icon (image) feel the same size despite different bounding boxes. See `references/icon-grid-and-stroke.md`. Off-grid, free-floating construction is the #1 inconsistency smell.
3. **Lock the stroke system and keep it optically constant.** Choose a nominal stroke (commonly **2px on a 24px grid**, i.e. ~1/12 of the artboard). The rule: **stroke weight is fixed across all glyphs at a given size** — never thin a stroke to fit a busy icon; simplify the icon instead. When scaling the set to other sizes, scale stroke *proportionally but snap to the pixel grid* (2px@24 → ~1.33px@16, hinted to 1.5px). Define corner radius (e.g. 2px outer), cap (butt/round) and join (round/miter) once, and apply everywhere. Mixed stroke weights are the single loudest "assembled from three libraries" tell.
4. **Write the metaphor rules and deconflict the set.** Each concept → exactly one glyph; each glyph → exactly one concept (no "gear" meaning both *settings* and *processing*). Fix **perspective uniformity** (all flat/front-on, or all the same isometric angle — never mixed), **fill consistency** (all outline or a stated outline+solid pairing for active states), and **directionality** (arrows, chevrons share one angle set). Audit the whole inventory side by side for collisions before refining any single glyph. RTL-mirror the directional ones (see `internationalization-and-rtl-design`).
5. **Correct for optical balance — visual, not mathematical.** Equalize **perceived area, not bounding box**: a circle and a triangle that fill the same square look smaller/lighter than a square, so overshoot circles slightly and grow triangles to match visual mass. **Center optically** — a play-triangle is centered on its visual center of mass, not its bounding box (nudge right). Align stems and counters to the pixel grid. These corrections are what separate a typographer-grade set from a math-grid set; document each compensation in `references/icon-grid-and-stroke.md`.
6. **Pixel-fit / hint for small UI sizes.** At 16–20px, snap strokes and key edges to whole/half pixels so glyphs stay crisp; **redraw, don't shrink**, the smallest size — drop detail and increase relative stroke so the 16px icon stays legible rather than a muddy down-scale of the 24px master. Maintain a separate optimized master per major size if the set ships below 20px.
7. **Make icons accessible and color-agnostic.** Icons are **monochrome by default and use `currentColor`** so they inherit text color and theme for free (ties to `dark-mode-and-theming`). A meaningful icon needs a text label or `aria-label`; a **decorative** icon is `aria-hidden`. Never rely on an icon's color alone to carry meaning (WCAG 2.2 **1.4.1**); when an icon sits in a control, the *control's* target is **≥ 24×24 CSS px** (2.5.8) — the glyph itself can be smaller (`doctrine/references/wcag-2.2-criteria.md`). Icon-only buttons must still have an accessible name.
8. **Define export + naming taxonomy.** Export a single optimized **SVG sprite** (or icon font) with a stable, namespaced naming scheme — `category-name-modifier` (`action-search`, `media-play`, `status-warning-fill`), kebab-case, no synonyms drift. Normalize viewBox to the artboard, strip editor cruft, keep paths as strokes-converted-to-fills *or* document that stroke is preserved for `currentColor` weight control. State the version and how additions are reviewed so the set does not fork.

## Anti-Patterns
- **The mixed-library set.** Three icons from Feather, two from Material, one from a random Dribbble file — different grids, weights, and metaphors. The most common slop signature in iconography.
- **Mixed stroke weights** (or thinning the stroke to cram detail into one busy glyph) — breaks the family instantly. Simplify the glyph instead.
- **Bounding-box ("mathematical") centering and sizing** — circles/triangles end up looking small and off-center because area and optical center were not compensated.
- **Off-grid, free-floating construction** — glyphs that ignore the live area and keylines render at visibly different sizes next to each other.
- **One glyph, two meanings** (or two glyphs, one meaning) — gear = settings *and* loading; trash *and* delete drawn differently. Metaphor collisions confuse users.
- **Mixed perspective/fill** — some flat, some isometric; some outline, some solid with no rule — the set looks unauthored.
- **Naive downscale to 16px** — a blurry shrink of the 24px master instead of a redrawn, pixel-fit small size.
- **Hard-coded color** instead of `currentColor`; meaning carried by color alone (fails 1.4.1); icon-only control with no accessible name.
- **No naming taxonomy** — `icon1`, `Group 47`, synonyms (`bin`/`trash`/`delete`) — guarantees duplicates and a forked set.

## Outputs
- A **stated style spec** (stroke px, cap/join, corner radius, outline/solid rule, character) named before production.
- A **construction grid**: artboard, live area, padding, and the keyline shapes with each glyph assigned to one.
- A **stroke system** with the constant-weight rule and the per-size scaling/hinting table.
- **Metaphor rules** and a deconflicted concept→glyph map (no collisions), with perspective/fill/direction conventions.
- **Optical-balance corrections** documented (area compensation, optical centering, stem alignment).
- A **sample icon set** drawn/specified to the system, plus the **export + naming taxonomy** (SVG sprite/font, kebab-case namespaced names, viewBox, `currentColor`, a11y rules).

## Examples
- `examples/icon-set-spec.md` — a complete, concrete icon-system spec: a 24px grid with live area + four keyline shapes, a 2px constant-stroke system with per-size hinting table, corner/cap/join language, metaphor & perspective rules, the optical-balance compensation table, and a worked **sample set** (search, settings, play, user, trash, chevron, image, warning) each placed on a keyline with its compensations and `currentColor`/a11y notes. Use it as the pattern for any new set. (See `CONTRIBUTING.md` — examples are mandatory and never lorem.)
