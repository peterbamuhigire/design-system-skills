description: Use when defining, building, or auditing an ILLUSTRATION language for a brand, product, site, deck, or document — the deliberate visual system that makes spot art and scenes look like one skilled hand drew them. Routes here for "illustration style guide", "spot illustration system", "scene/hero illustration", "character construction rules", "illustration style attributes" (line/shape/colour/perspective), "ownable visual motif", "make our illustrations consistent across a set", "when to illustrate instead of photograph", "fix our generic blob-people illustrations", and the explicit kill of corporate-memphis / blob-people / flat-default slop. Treats illustration as a constructed system (like type or icons), not clip-art commissioned one frame at a time. Sibling to photography-art-direction (when to photograph) and iconography-system-design (the reductive grid-bound cousin).

# Illustration Style & Systems

<!-- dual-compat-start -->

Illustration is the most *ownable* imagery a brand has — a photo can be re-shot by anyone, but a
specific drawn language is a signature competitors cannot buy off a shelf. That is exactly why it
is also the most-faked: the "corporate Memphis" / blob-people flat style (oversized limbs,
faceless purple figures, tiny heads, confetti shapes) became the default of an entire era of tech
marketing precisely because it is easy to mass-produce — and is now the single loudest
illustration slop signal there is. This skill makes illustration a **deliberate, constructed
system** with stated attributes and an ownable motif, exactly as the doctrine Mission demands
("the moat is looking human-made", `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §0). The goal is a language a
viewer could recognise as *yours* with the logo cropped off.

## Use When
- Defining an **illustration style system** for a brand/product: the style attributes (line,
  shape, colour, perspective/space) that every drawing must obey so the set reads as one author.
- Building a **spot-art system** (small inline illustrations: empty states, feature tiles,
  onboarding, error pages) and/or a **scene system** (larger hero/editorial compositions) — and
  defining how the two relate (shared DNA, different density).
- Writing **character/object construction rules** — proportion, anatomy/joint logic, face
  language, how objects are built from the same primitives — so any illustrator can extend the set
  on-model.
- Designing an **ownable motif** — the one repeatable, distinctive move (a signature line
  treatment, a recurring shape grammar, a specific imperfect texture) that makes the work
  unmistakable and un-generic.
- Deciding **when illustration beats photography** (and vice versa) for a given surface.
- Auditing existing illustration for the slop signature: corporate-Memphis blob-people, mixed
  styles bought from three marketplaces, default flat-vector sameness — and remaking it on-system.
- Directing an **AI image generator** toward a *defined* illustration system (only where the
  surface permits) and gating the output against the slop tells.

## Do Not Use When
- The asset is **photography or photo-realistic AI imagery** (treatment, crop, sourcing) →
  `photography-art-direction` (sibling). That skill owns *when to photograph*; this one owns *when
  and how to illustrate*.
- The asset is a **functional icon / icon set** → `iconography-system-design` (sibling).
  Iconography is reductive, grid-bound, monochrome, and metaphor-locked; illustration is
  expressive, scene-capable, and colour-rich. If it lives in a 24px live area and means one
  concept, it's an icon, not an illustration.
- It is a **chart, diagram, or data graphic** → group 12 (`data-visualization`).
- It is **brand colour-palette construction** itself → `color-system-and-palette` /
  `accessible-color-and-contrast`; this skill *consumes* the palette and adds illustration-only
  tints, it does not define the brand palette.
- You are running the **product-wide visual slop audit** (UI + features) → cross-cutting
  `visual-product-slop-audit` (group 00/04). This skill owns *illustration direction*.

## Required Inputs
- The **brand**: voice/positioning, audience, and the one idea the illustration must carry
  (warmth? rigour? play? craft?). Illustration is interpretive — state the read before drawing.
- The **surfaces and sizes**: spot (16–80px / small tile), inline (200–480px), hero/scene
  (full-bleed), document/deck — each constrains detail density and stroke.
- The **inventory**: the concrete list of things to illustrate (empty states, features, concepts,
  characters) so the set is deconflicted and built to one system, not commissioned ad hoc.
- The **existing assets**: brand palette, type voice, and any icon system the illustration must
  sit beside without clashing.
- **Sourcing path**: in-house illustrator, commission, or AI-assisted (and whether AI output is
  acceptable on this surface at all — truth/people surfaces usually are not).

## Workflow
1. **State the style choice before drawing a single frame** (the anti-slop non-negotiable #1,
   `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §2). One paragraph naming the five **style attributes**
   concretely — not adjectives:
   - **Line:** present or absent; if present, weight (e.g. 2.5px), variable vs uniform, terminal
     and join language, hand-drawn wobble vs geometric-clean.
   - **Shape:** geometric vs organic; corner language; fill style (flat / textured / gradient-
     within-a-defined-ramp); how forms are built from a small primitive set.
   - **Colour:** the illustration palette as a *constrained ramp* drawn from the brand palette
     (how many tints, the shadow/light logic, whether outline colour is fixed or tinted) — never
     the full rainbow, never the default flat-vector primaries.
   - **Perspective / space:** flat/front-on, isometric (one fixed angle), or naive-depth — pick
     **one** and hold it across the whole set; mixed perspective is an instant "assembled" tell.
   - **Texture / finish:** clean-vector, grain, halftone, paper, brush — the finish is often where
     the *ownable* signature lives.
   If you cannot write this paragraph, you are not ready to draw. See
   `references/illustration-system.md` §Style attributes.
2. **Choose the ownable motif — the one signature move** (`doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §0:
   prefer the choice a templating tool would never produce). Restraint plus one strong move beats
   five hedged ones: a recurring shape grammar, a distinctive imperfect line, a single accent
   texture, a consistent "broken-grid" composition, a recurring character of light. This is the
   thing that survives the logo being cropped off. Generic flat vector has *no* motif — that is
   precisely why it reads as slop. See `references/illustration-system.md` §Ownable motif.
3. **Decide spot vs scene, and how they relate.** Spot art is reductive — one idea, low detail
   density, reads at thumbnail size; scene art carries narrative, more depth, more characters.
   They must share DNA (same line/shape/colour/perspective attributes) but scale detail with size.
   Define the **density ladder**: what drops out as the illustration shrinks (a spot icon-scale
   illustration drops texture and background; the hero keeps them). See
   `references/illustration-system.md` §Spot vs scene.
4. **Write character / object construction rules.** So any illustrator extends the set on-model:
   proportion system (head-to-body ratio, hand/foot treatment), **anatomy and joint logic** (how
   limbs bend, whether figures have faces and what the face language is), **diversity handled with
   dignity** (real variation in body/skin/age/ability — *not* the faceless-everyone dodge), and
   how inanimate objects are built from the same primitives and line as the characters. Explicitly
   forbid the corporate-Memphis defaults (see Anti-Patterns). See
   `references/illustration-system.md` §Construction.
5. **Enforce consistency across the set.** Audit the whole inventory side by side before refining
   any single frame: one line weight, one shape language, one perspective, one colour ramp, one
   finish. The slop tell is a *set* that looks bought from three marketplaces. Build a small
   **component kit** (reusable characters, objects, backgrounds, accent shapes) so new
   illustrations are assembled on-system rather than improvised. See
   `references/illustration-system.md` §Consistency kit.
6. **Decide when illustration beats photography** for each surface, and state why
   (cross-check `photography-art-direction`). Illustration wins for: abstract/conceptual ideas with
   no literal subject (privacy, automation, "how it works"), schematic explanation, playful or
   editorial tone, owning a look photography can't (no stock can match a signature drawn language),
   and **avoiding the cost/cliché of stock people**. Photography wins for: truth claims (real
   people, real places, real product), credibility/trust surfaces, and anywhere "is this real?" is
   the question. State the call per surface in the spec. See `references/illustration-system.md`
   §Illustration vs photography.
7. **If sourcing AI:** only toward a **defined** system, only where the surface permits (never
   truth/people surfaces), and only when a human can re-draw/clean it onto the motif. Write the
   prompt + the negative-constraint list keyed to the slop tells, and run the reject gate
   (`doctrine/references/ai-slop-taxonomy.md` §Visual tells: melted detail, gibberish text,
   warped logos, six-finger anatomy, mismatched lighting). Per doctrine §2 sourcing-authority
   rule, an AI tool's *own* default illustration style (it is trained on the corporate-Memphis
   ocean) is **never** the authority for the look — it is the convergent mean we art-direct
   *away* from. See `references/illustration-system.md` §AI-assisted, gated.
8. **Accessibility & performance.** Every meaningful illustration needs `alt` text conveying its
   point (decorative → empty alt); never carry essential meaning in colour alone (WCAG 2.2
   **1.4.1**) — pair with shape/label; ensure text set over an illustration meets contrast
   (`doctrine/references/wcag-2.2-criteria.md`). Ship as optimised **SVG** where it stays vector
   (huge weight win, infinite scale, themeable via `currentColor`); rasterise only complex
   textured scenes, inside the LCP budget (`doctrine/references/web-performance-budgets-2026.md`).

## Anti-Patterns
- **Corporate Memphis / "Alegria" / blob-people** — faceless figures with oversized limbs and
  tiny heads, gangly noodle arms, flat saturated purple/coral, confetti geometric shapes floating
  for no reason. The defining illustration slop of the era; banned outright. It reads as "we
  bought the default" and signals no authored choice (`doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §0/§2).
- **Generic flat-vector with no motif** — clean, competent, and completely interchangeable with
  ten thousand other brands. Competence without a signature is still slop here.
- **The mixed-marketplace set** — illustrations bought from three different sources: different line
  weights, perspectives, and colour logic sitting side by side. The single loudest "unauthored"
  tell, the illustration cousin of the mixed-icon-library smell.
- **Mixed perspective / mixed finish in one set** — some flat, some isometric; some grain, some
  clean-vector — no stated rule.
- **Faceless-everyone as a diversity dodge** — removing faces/identity to "be inclusive" is the
  corporate-Memphis cop-out; depict real, dignified human variation instead.
- **Rainbow palette / default flat primaries** — ignoring a constrained ramp drawn from the brand.
- **Illustrating a truth claim** — drawing "our happy customers" instead of showing real ones;
  illustration is interpretive, so using it where credibility is the job misleads. Photograph it.
- **AI illustration shipped un-vetted** — melted detail, gibberish labels, warped logos, six
  fingers (`ai-slop-taxonomy.md` §2 "shovelware assets" — the highest public-backlash risk), or
  simply the AI's default corporate-Memphis regurgitation.
- **Decorative sparkle/gradient "illustration"** with no subject and no benefit — slop by the
  taxonomy's product/interface tells.

## Outputs
- A **stated style spec**: the five style attributes (line, shape, colour ramp, perspective,
  finish) named concretely *before* production.
- The **ownable motif** — the one signature move, documented and applied across the set.
- A **spot-vs-scene system** with the density ladder (what scales with size).
- **Character/object construction rules** (proportion, anatomy, face language, dignified
  diversity, object-from-primitives) that keep the set on-model.
- A **consistency kit** (reusable characters/objects/backgrounds/accents) + the audited,
  deconflicted inventory.
- A per-surface **illustration-vs-photography decision** with reasons.
- A worked **sample set** drawn/specified to the system, with a11y (alt/contrast) and
  SVG/weight/`currentColor` export notes; and (if AI) the prompt + negatives + reject gate.

## Examples
- `examples/illustration-style-spec.md` — a complete, concrete illustration-style spec for a
  sample brand ("Maduuka Merchant Tools", a small-business commerce product): the five named style
  attributes with numbers, the ownable motif, the spot-vs-scene density ladder, character/object
  construction rules, the constrained colour ramp, a per-surface illustration-vs-photography
  table, and a described **sample set** (empty-cart spot, "sync" feature tile, an onboarding
  scene, a 404) each on-system — plus the explicit corporate-Memphis rejection and the AI reject
  gate. Reusable as a template — not lorem. (See `CONTRIBUTING.md` — examples are mandatory and
  never lorem.)
