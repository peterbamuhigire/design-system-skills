description: Use when generating ANY imagery with an AI image model (Midjourney, DALL·E, Imagen, Stable Diffusion, Flux, Firefly, etc.) for a brand, website, deck, document, app, illustration, key art, OG card, icon-set base, or texture — and you need it to look AUTHORED, not slop. Routes here for turning an art-direction brief into a prompt, building the negative-constraint list, running the reject/accept gate against the AI-slop visual tells (waxy skin, melted backgrounds, gibberish text, extra fingers, no-author style-blend), post-processing/integration so generation is the start not the ship, provenance/licensing caution (training-data rights, C2PA, indemnity, truth-claim surfaces), and the decision of when NOT to use AI imagery at all. Pairs with photography-art-direction (photo sourcing/treatment) and visual-product-slop-audit (the product-wide reject gate).

# AI Image Generation & Art Direction

<!-- dual-compat-start -->

An AI image model is a slot machine that pays out the **convergent mean of its training data** by
default — and that mean *is* the slop the engine exists to fight (`doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §0,
"the moat is looking human-made"). Generation is cheap, so the gravity is toward sameness:
plastic light, creamy bokeh, styleless competence, "made by nobody." This skill makes AI imagery a
**directed, gated, post-processed, provenance-checked** act — the difference between a designer
*using* a tool and a tool *producing* slop. The generator's own aesthetic defaults are **never** the
authority for the look; we art-direct *away* from them, exactly as we do with banned default fonts
(`doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §2, sourcing-authority asymmetry rule).

## Use When
- Generating imagery with any AI model — Midjourney, DALL·E, Imagen, Stable Diffusion, Flux,
  Firefly, etc. — for a brand, hero, inline, background, deck, report cover, OG card, illustration,
  key art, icon-set base, or texture/pattern.
- Turning an **art-direction brief into a prompt** (subject + action + lens + light + mood + grade),
  and attaching the **negative-constraint list** keyed to the slop tells.
- Running the **reject/accept gate** on candidate frames before anything is kept.
- **Post-processing & integrating** a passed frame — re-grade, re-crop, fix micro-anatomy, composite
  into the brand treatment system so it stops reading as "a generation."
- Deciding **provenance & licensing**: is this model's output safe to ship (training-data rights,
  commercial terms, indemnity), and does the surface carry a **truth claim** that forbids AI people.
- Deciding **when NOT to use AI imagery at all** and routing back up the sourcing ladder.

## Do Not Use When
- You are directing **real or commissioned photography / stock sourcing & treatment** (grade, grain,
  duotone, crop system) — that is `photography-art-direction` (this group). It owns the *photo*
  sourcing ladder and treatment recipe; this skill owns *generation-specific* prompting, gating,
  and provenance. (They cross-reference; the AI-direction block in that skill points here for depth.)
- You are running the **product-wide visual slop audit** across imagery + UI + AI features →
  `visual-product-slop-audit` (group 00). That owns the audit/reject gate across a whole product;
  this skill owns *generating* imagery that would pass it.
- The concern is the **typeface / type system** → `ai-slop-typography-audit` (group 01).
- The asset is a hand-built **vector illustration or icon set** (not generated) → the illustration /
  `iconography-system-design` skills (this group).

## Required Inputs
- The **art-direction brief** (or enough to write one): brand voice/positioning, audience, the one
  feeling the image must carry, where it lives (surface + rendered size + aspect ratios).
- The **surface's truth status**: does it make a claim about *real* people, places, customers,
  outcomes (medical/financial/testimonial)? If yes, AI people are forbidden (see Workflow 1).
- The **treatment recipe** the output must land in (grade/grain/crop/ratios) — usually from
  `photography-art-direction/references/photo-treatment-system.md`.
- The **model + its licensing terms**: commercial-use rights, training-data provenance, indemnity,
  and whether it emits content-credentials (C2PA). See `references/ai-image-direction-and-gate.md` §4.

## Workflow
1. **Decide if AI imagery is even allowed here first** (the gate before the gate). If the surface
   makes a **truth claim** — real customers, "our team," a clinical/financial outcome, a named place —
   AI-generated people/scenes are **forbidden** (the "shovelware assets" backlash trap,
   `doctrine/references/ai-slop-taxonomy.md` §2). Route up the sourcing ladder to a real shoot
   (`photography-art-direction`). AI is admissible only for **conceptual, abstract, background, or
   non-claiming** imagery, on a surface that permits it. See `references/ai-image-direction-and-gate.md` §1.
2. **State the intent first** (Anti-Slop non-negotiable #1, `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §2). One
   sentence: *subject world + action + light + distance + mood*. If you cannot say it, you are not
   ready to generate — you will get the model's mean instead of your choice.
3. **Write the prompt like a photographer/illustrator, not a slot machine.** Specify subject +
   *specific* action (mid-task, not posed), lens/medium + framing, light (named source/direction),
   mood + realism cues (natural texture, slightly imperfect), and a grade hint matching the
   treatment recipe. Concrete construction in `references/ai-image-direction-and-gate.md` §2.
4. **Attach the negative-constraint list**, keyed directly to the `ai-slop-taxonomy.md` visual tells —
   waxy/plastic skin, over-smoothed faces, extra/fused fingers, melted/dissolving backgrounds,
   floating objects, gibberish text/signage, warped/misspelled logos, uncanny eyes, mismatched
   lighting, plus the cliché stand-ins (lens-flare skyline, glowing-blue HUD, isolated-on-white).
   Full list in `references/ai-image-direction-and-gate.md` §3.
5. **Run the reject/accept gate on every candidate** (`references/ai-image-direction-and-gate.md` §5).
   Reject if *any* classic tell OR any **2026 migrated tell** fires — the obvious six-finger artifact
   is largely fixed in late-2025/2026 models, so the live tells are now plastic default-render light,
   texture-too-even, micro-anatomy/accessory errors on zoom (teeth, earrings, watch faces, fused
   hair), garbled small text/UI/gauges, impossible reflections, and the **no-author style-blend**
   ("made by nobody"). The 2026 rule: the tell is the **absence of authored specificity**. Ask
   *"would a named designer have made this exact choice?"* — if no, it is slop with zero hard anomalies.
6. **Post-process & integrate a passed frame** — generation is the *start*, never the ship. Re-grade
   into the treatment recipe, re-crop hard (off-centre, kill the default centre-punch), repair
   micro-anatomy/zoom errors, add real-world grain/noise to kill the too-even texture, composite with
   brand elements so it reads as a *composition*, not a borrowed generation. Steps in
   `references/ai-image-direction-and-gate.md` §6. If it cannot be made to read as authored, it failed.
7. **Record provenance & licensing** before ship: model + version, that commercial rights/indemnity
   were checked, any C2PA/content-credentials, and the one-line decision record (Workflow 8). Strip
   stray watermark ghosts; never pass off AI output as a real photo of a real subject.
8. **State the one-line decision record** (per `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §2): *"<surface>: AI
   imagery permitted because <non-claim reason>; model <name/ver>, rights checked; passed the reject
   gate; re-graded/cropped into <recipe>."* No generated image ships without this sentence — an
   unstated choice is a reflexive default, exactly what the Charter exists to stop.

## Anti-Patterns
- **Generating onto a truth-claim surface** — AI "customers," AI "our team," an AI clinician on a
  real-care page. The single highest public-backlash risk (`ai-slop-taxonomy.md` §2).
- **Shipping the raw generation** — straight out of the model, ungraded, uncropped, unrepaired. Like
  raw stock, the failure is shipping it *unauthored*.
- **Prompting in adjectives, not direction** — "beautiful, professional, high quality, 4k, trending"
  yields the convergent mean. Direct subject/light/lens/medium, not vibes.
- **No negative list** — letting the model's defaults (plastic skin, creamy bokeh, golden-hour-on-
  everything) through untouched.
- **Accepting the no-author style-blend** because it has "no obvious errors" — styleless competence is
  the *core* moat-failure (`ai-slop-taxonomy.md` migrated tells), not a pass.
- **Decorative AI sparkle/gradient as "imagery"** with no subject and no benefit — slop by the
  product/interface tells.
- **Ignoring provenance** — embedding output whose training-data rights / commercial terms / indemnity
  were never checked, or laundering an AI render as a genuine photograph.

## Outputs
- A **generation brief**: intent sentence, the prompt, the negative-constraint list, and the
  accept/reject gate — ready to run against any model.
- A **gate run** per candidate: tick-listed tells, pass/reject, and (on reject) the reason and next move.
- A **passed, post-processed frame** integrated into the treatment recipe — plus the provenance +
  licensing note and the one-line decision record.

## Examples
- `examples/ai-image-brief-and-gate-run.md` — a complete worked case for a sample brand
  ("Maduuka" small-merchant platform): the surface decision (why AI is allowed here), the intent
  sentence, the full prompt + negative list, and a **gate run on two real candidates** — one
  **rejected** (waxy skin + garbled signage + no-author blend, with reasons) and one **accepted**
  (with the post-processing + provenance note). Reusable as a template — not lorem.
