# Cross-Platform Design Parity

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- One product must ship on iOS **and** Android and you must decide, per element, what stays identical and what becomes platform-native.
- You are writing a single design/handoff spec that two platform teams (or one RN/Flutter team) will both build from.
- A design was authored on one platform (usually iOS in Figma) and needs an honest Android translation — not a pixel copy.
- You are using React Native or Flutter and must decide where to use one shared UI versus where to branch per platform.
- A stakeholder asks "shouldn't it just look the same on both?" and you need a defensible answer.

## Do Not Use When

- The work targets only one platform with no parity requirement — use `ios-ui-ux-design` or `android-ui-ux-design` directly.
- The task is platform-specific implementation detail (SwiftUI layout, Compose state) with no parity decision — use the single-platform skill's references.
- It is purely backend/API work with no shared UI surface.

## Required Inputs

- The screens/flows in scope, the single source-of-truth design (Figma, screenshots, or a token set), and which platform it was authored on.
- The brand system: typeface(s), colour tokens, logo, voice — the things that MUST stay constant across platforms.
- The build target: native Swift+Kotlin, React Native, or Flutter (this changes the mapping, not the parity decisions).
- Target device classes (compact phone, large phone, tablet/foldable), Apple resizable windows/Mac-designed-for-iPhone behavior when relevant, and minimum OS versions (these gate Liquid Glass / Material 3 Expressive availability).

## The Parity Principle (state this before specifying anything)

**Unify meaning; diverge mechanism.** A user on either platform should recognise the same brand, the same content, the same information architecture, and complete the same task in the same number of steps. *How* they touch it — the navigation container, the control widgets, the transitions, the gestures, the system chrome — must be **native to their platform**. A design that is pixel-identical on both platforms is a slop signal: it means the author defaulted to one platform's idioms and forced the other to wear them. See `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §0 — the moat is looking authored, and an idiomatically-correct port is the authored choice.

| Layer | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Brand: logo, colour, type, illustration, photography, voice | **Unify** | This is identity. Divergence here reads as two different apps. |
| Content & data model | **Unify** | Same product, same truth. |
| Information architecture & task flows | **Unify** | Same mental model; same step count. |
| Navigation container (tab bar vs nav rail, back model) | **Diverge** | Each OS has a learned home for these. |
| Standard controls (pickers, switches, sheets, menus, dates) | **Diverge** | Use the OS-native control; users trust the muscle memory. |
| Motion & transitions | **Diverge** | iOS push/sheet physics ≠ Material container-transform. |
| Gestures & system chrome (back, status/nav bars, safe areas) | **Diverge** | OS-owned; fighting them breaks the platform contract. |
| Bespoke brand moments (hero, onboarding, empty-state art) | **Unify** | This is where you spend your distinctiveness budget on both. |

See `references/ios-vs-android-idioms.md` for the element-by-element divergence table, and `references/rn-flutter-mapping.md` for how each row resolves in React Native and Flutter.

## Workflow

1. **Name the source of truth and the brand constants.** State the typeface(s) and palette intent against the anti-slop charter — see `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` and `doctrine/references/ai-slop-banned-fonts.md` — *once*, because brand is the unified layer and must read identically on both platforms. Note the platform-font caveat: SF Pro on iOS and Roboto on Android are allowed *as system UI text*; a branded display face still comes from `doctrine/references/font-groups-and-usage.md`.
2. **Classify every element** in scope into Unify or Diverge using the table above and `references/ios-vs-android-idioms.md`. Produce this as an explicit list — never leave it implicit.
3. **For each Diverge element, name both native resolutions** (the iOS HIG component and the Android Material 3 component) and the version gate (for example, current Apple SDK Liquid Glass/SF Symbols 8 availability and Material 3 Expressive token availability).
4. **Map to the build technology** using `references/rn-flutter-mapping.md`: decide per element whether to use a shared component, a platform-adaptive component (`Platform.select` / Flutter `.adaptive` / `Theme.of(context).platform`), or two distinct implementations.
5. **Model every shared state** on both platforms: loading, content, empty, error, offline, permission-denied, syncing — confirm each diverges only where the platform demands (e.g. permission dialogs are OS-owned).
6. **Apply both single-platform quality gates.** Run the screen through `ios-ui-ux-design` and `android-ui-ux-design` checks; the parity spec passes only when each platform's native build would independently pass its own gate.
7. **Write the parity spec** as a side-by-side sheet (see `examples/parity-spec-one-screen.md`). One row per element: Unified value, iOS resolution, Android resolution, rationale.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Pixel-identical cloning** — shipping iOS's design on Android (bottom tab bar copied as a non-native widget, iOS back-chevron with no Android system back, sheets that ignore Material). This is the #1 cross-platform failure.
- **Lowest-common-denominator flattening** — using only the components both platforms share, so the app feels generic and native to neither.
- **Diverging the brand** — letting the two platforms drift into different colours, type, or voice "because the OS does it that way." Brand is the unified layer.
- **Unstated divergence** — diverging without writing down *why*, so the next designer "fixes" it back to identical.
- **Forgetting version gates** — speccing Liquid Glass or Material 3 Expressive without checking the minimum OS / token availability, leaving older devices with a broken fallback.
- **Ignoring Apple windowing/resizability** - treating iPhone, iPad, and Mac-designed-for-iPhone as one fixed phone canvas instead of testing compact/regular width, pointer, keyboard, and safe-area changes.
- **RN/Flutter "write once" complacency** — assuming the framework makes it native automatically. It does not; adaptive components and per-platform branches are deliberate choices.

## Outputs

- A parity spec: the Unify/Diverge classification, a side-by-side element sheet (unified value · iOS resolution · Android resolution · rationale), the RN/Flutter mapping, the state matrix, and the version-gate notes.

## Examples

- `examples/parity-spec-one-screen.md` — the SAME screen (a transactions list + detail in a fintech app) specced for iOS and Android side by side: what stays, what diverges, and why, down to the control level.

## References

- `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` — the always-load anti-slop charter; §0 (looking human-made/authored) is the basis for "idiomatic port, not clone."
- `doctrine/references/ai-slop-banned-fonts.md`, `doctrine/references/font-groups-and-usage.md`, and `doctrine/references/type-scale-and-spacing.md` for the unified brand type system and the SF Pro / Roboto system-font caveat.
- `doctrine/references/wcag-2.2-criteria.md` — accessibility floor both platforms must clear (target size, contrast, focus); note iOS minimum touch target is 44 pt and Android 48 dp.
- `references/ios-vs-android-idioms.md` — element-by-element comparison: navigation, controls, typography, motion, gestures, system chrome (HIG / Liquid Glass / SF Symbols 8 vs Material 3 Expressive).
- `references/rn-flutter-mapping.md` — how each design element maps to React Native and Flutter components, and when to go shared vs platform-adaptive vs branched.
- Pair with `ios-ui-ux-design` and `android-ui-ux-design` (same group) — this skill decides the split; those two skills perfect each native side.
