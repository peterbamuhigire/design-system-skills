# Infographic Systems

Parent skill: [`data-illustration-and-infographics`](../SKILL.md).

This is an original, copyright-safe synthesis of the supplied visual communication books. It records transferable concepts, not protected passages, source-specific layouts, or copied examples.

## Source Map

| Supplied book | Durable concept admitted | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Nigel Holmes, *Joyful Infographics* | Friendly explanation, humane pictorial language, metaphor, editing, labels, drawing, and context-fit joy | Humour is optional; it never overrides truth or subject sensitivity |
| Beverley E. Crane, *Infographics* | Self-contained message, research/editing before design, audience fit, practical production, and evaluation | Library examples do not become universal audience evidence |
| Kristen Sosulski, *Data Visualization Made Simple* | Move from question and data literacy through graphics, design, audience, presentation, and cases | Historical teaching text; no current tool or platform claim |
| Andy Kirk et al., *Data Visualization: Representing Information on Modern Web* | Purpose, intent, editorial focus, design options, taxonomy, annotation, arrangement, interactivity, and evaluation | Web implementation details require current technical verification |
| Nathan Yau, *Visualize This* | Story-first exploration of time, proportions, relationships, differences, space, and purposeful design | Code and APIs are historical examples; do not treat them as current commands |
| Jonathan Schwabish, *Better Presentations* | Plan before software, audience-centred structure, visual hierarchy, restrained colour/type, pre-attentive focus, and presentation-specific design | Presentation settings and software behaviour require current checks |
| Gene Zelazny, *Say It with Charts* | Match chart form to message, make the “so what” visible, and practise selecting and redrawing exhibits | Workbook exercises are prompts, not a license to reproduce its pages |
| Stephen Wildish, *Chartography* | Playful classification, visual surprise, and the creative permission to find unusual but legible forms | Nonsense and novelty must never be presented as factual evidence |

## The World-Class System

### 1. Start with a decision, not a canvas

Write: `audience -> decision -> evidence -> takeaway -> action`. If the action cannot be named, the visual is probably decoration or an exploratory artifact rather than a finished infographic.

### 2. Build an editorial spine

Use a short sequence:

1. **Orientation:** what is this and why should this reader care?
2. **Tension:** what pattern, problem, contrast, or question matters?
3. **Reveal:** what does the evidence show?
4. **Mechanism:** how does it happen or what should the reader notice?
5. **Implication:** why does the finding matter?
6. **Action:** what should the reader do, decide, remember, or ask next?

Cut any panel that does not move this spine forward. A self-contained infographic needs its own conclusion, not merely a collection of attractive facts.

### 3. Choose the truthful form

| Story job | First candidate | Add only when needed |
|---|---|---|
| Compare categories | Sorted horizontal bars, dot plot, or table | Pictorial accent for recognition |
| Show change over time | Line, slope, small multiples, or annotated timeline | Illustrative milestones |
| Explain a process | Flow or numbered diagram | Human or object drawings |
| Explain a system | Relationship map or causal diagram | Interaction or progressive reveal |
| Show part-to-whole | Stacked bar, unit/waffle, or treemap | Pictorial units only with explicit base |
| Show place | Dot, proportional symbol, or choropleth map | Landmark or geographic illustration |
| Explain an object | Cutaway, anatomy, or labelled diagram | Texture and character for approachability |
| Make a qualitative taxonomy | Matrix, spectrum, Venn, or pictorial classification | Playful metaphor or visual pun |

Do not select a form because it is fashionable. Record the message it serves and the failure it avoids.

### 4. Use metaphor as a comprehension tool

Choose a metaphor with three tests:

- **Fit:** the metaphor matches the subject's logic, not just its surface appearance.
- **Lift:** it makes an invisible relationship, scale, or process easier to see.
- **Restraint:** it does not introduce a second story or imply unsupported meaning.

One coherent visual vocabulary is stronger than a collage of unrelated icons. If the metaphor and chart disagree, the chart wins.

### 5. Create hierarchy through contrast and space

Use contrast deliberately across scale, position, weight, colour, and density. Establish one focal point, then a reading path, then detail. Reserve accent colour for the one point the audience must remember or act on. Keep labels close to the marks they describe. Use space to separate chapters of the story and to let data breathe.

The system must work in a thumbnail, at the target viewing size, and when printed or compressed. A “busy” composition is not automatically rich; it is often an unresolved editorial decision.

### 6. Make joy humane and conditional

Warmth can lower the intimidation of numbers. Use a friendly voice, recognisable human situations, visual wit, or a gentle surprise when the audience and subject allow it. Do not use jokes, cartoon violence, caricature, gamified rewards, or playful distortion for tragedy, health risk, discrimination, or other high-stakes subjects. In those cases, joy means clarity, dignity, and the relief of understanding.

### 7. Treat words as part of the visual

Titles should state the finding or question. Subtitles provide scope. Labels eliminate legend work. Annotations explain the “why now” or “so what”. Captions clarify unusual marks. The source note records provenance, period, unit, and limitations. Write alt text as a compact reading of the complete message, not as a list of colours and shapes.

### 8. Keep measurement honest

- Use position and length for exact comparison whenever possible.
- Use a common baseline for bars; show a broken or non-zero baseline explicitly.
- Do not scale pictograms by area or volume without explaining the encoding.
- Preserve denominators, missing values, units, time periods, and uncertainty.
- Do not let perspective, 3D, shadows, or decorative texture change apparent magnitude.
- If data is illustrative, label it `illustrative` in the visual and prompt.

### 9. Design for the handoff

The production brief should include canvas, safe area, type roles, colour roles, chart geometry, content hierarchy, assets, rights, output formats, responsive variants, source note, alt text, and review gates. A separate AI tool should receive a structured brief, not an aesthetic adjective such as “make it stunning”.

## AI Production Prompt Contract

Give the production tool these fields:

```text
PROJECT: [name]
AUDIENCE: [specific reader and knowledge level]
DECISION/ACTION: [what the reader should decide or do]
VISUAL THESIS: [one sentence describing the authored idea]
TAKEAWAY: [one factual or labelled illustrative conclusion]
DATA: [values, units, period, denominators, uncertainty, source]
FORM: [chart, diagram, map, timeline, comparison, or hybrid]
METAPHOR: [one metaphor and why it improves comprehension]
READING ORDER: [numbered sequence from entry to conclusion]
TEXT: [title, subtitle, labels, annotations, source note, CTA]
VISUAL LANGUAGE: [type pair, palette roles, line/shape vocabulary, illustration rule]
MEDIUMS: [print, slide, desktop web, mobile, social; dimensions]
ACCESSIBILITY: [contrast, non-colour cues, alt text, text equivalent, reading order]
RIGHTS: [approved assets, font licence, attribution, AI provenance]
DO NOT: [unsupported claims, copied layouts, decorative defaults, false precision]
OUTPUTS: [editable source, raster/vector exports, mobile variant, text alternative]
CHECKS: [data, scale, labels, greyscale, CVD, 200% zoom, thumbnail, reviewer]
```

Require the tool to return a short decision record before generating the final asset. Reject any output that invents data, silently changes the encoding, or cannot state what the viewer should notice first.

## Release Checklist

- [ ] The audience, decision, visual thesis, and single takeaway are named.
- [ ] The data and source status are known; illustrative values are labelled.
- [ ] The chosen form fits the story and preserves perceptual accuracy.
- [ ] The metaphor is singular, purposeful, and culturally appropriate.
- [ ] The title states the point; labels and units sit near the evidence.
- [ ] One focal point is emphasised; decoration does not compete with it.
- [ ] Colour has a role and is backed by text, shape, pattern, or position.
- [ ] The visual survives thumbnail, target size, greyscale, CVD, and 200% zoom review.
- [ ] Alt text or a text-equivalent narrative is supplied.
- [ ] Sources, rights, fonts, asset provenance, and AI involvement are recorded.
- [ ] At least one human reviewer has read the visual as a first-time viewer.
- [ ] Missing render, rights, accessibility, or source evidence remains `NOT_ASSESSED` and blocks a world-class claim.
