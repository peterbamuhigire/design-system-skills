# Data Illustration And Infographics

Own the visual translation of a complex idea into a memorable, truthful, self-contained visual argument.

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- The output is an infographic, visual explainer, pictorial data story, annotated process, timeline, map-led story, comparison poster, or chart-and-illustration composition.
- The visual must work without a live presenter explaining every element.
- The brief needs an authored metaphor, human warmth, editorial hierarchy, or a distinctive visual signature in addition to accurate data.
- A chart alone is not enough because the audience needs context, sequence, mechanism, or a conclusion.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is one analytical chart with no multi-element story; use `data-visualization`.
- The task is chart-type selection; use `chart-selection-and-encoding`.
- The task is a dashboard page, KPI tile system, drill-down, or cross-filtered data product; use `dashboard-and-data-product-design`.
- The task is only brand colour, typography, illustration production, or accessibility remediation; route to the matching sibling skill and use this skill only for the infographic story.

## Required Inputs

| Artefact or context | Source | Required? | Why |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Decision, audience, desired action, and single takeaway | Brief owner | yes | Defines the visual thesis and stopping point |
| Validated data, definitions, units, period, denominators, and uncertainty | Data owner or evidence pack | yes for factual claims | Prevents persuasive decoration from becoming misinformation |
| Medium, dimensions, viewing distance, responsive target, and distribution context | Publisher | yes | Controls density, type size, interaction, and alternate formats |
| Brand, cultural, tone, and subject-sensitivity constraints | Brand or domain owner | conditional | Prevents a playful treatment from trivialising a serious subject |
| Licensed assets, fonts, icons, image provenance, and AI-output status | Production owner | conditional | Establishes lawful, attributable production |

## Workflow

1. **Frame the job.** Write the audience, decision, consequence of misunderstanding, medium, and one-sentence visual thesis. Load `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` and the portfolio craft loop.
2. **Reduce the editorial question.** Convert the brief into one primary question, one conclusion, and no more than three supporting beats. Put surplus facts in an appendix or companion text.
3. **Audit the evidence.** Check source, definitions, missingness, scale, uncertainty, and whether each number supports the intended conclusion. Route current claims through Digital Research; books supply durable concepts only.
4. **Choose the visual grammar.** Decide whether the story is comparative, temporal, spatial, proportional, causal, procedural, categorical, or explanatory. Choose the most truthful chart or diagram before styling.
5. **Invent the metaphor deliberately.** Select one visual metaphor or pictorial vocabulary that improves comprehension and belongs to this subject. Record why it fits; reject borrowed compositions and decorative metaphor that competes with the data.
6. **Storyboard the reading path.** Sketch title, orientation, main exhibit, annotations, supporting detail, source note, and conclusion in the order a reader will scan. Use generous space and a clear entry point.
7. **Build in layers.** Establish the data layer first, then labels and annotations, then restrained illustration, then brand and finishing details. Use one focal accent and a controlled type pair; consult colour, typography, composition, imagery, and accessibility siblings.
8. **Make the visual self-explaining.** Direct-label important values, explain symbols, show units and period, state the conclusion, and provide alt text or a text-equivalent narrative. Never make a legend, colour, or animation carry meaning alone.
9. **Exercise failure paths.** Test a missing value, long label, narrow viewport, greyscale print, colour-vision deficiency, 200% zoom, screen reader reading order, and a serious-topic or low-attention interpretation.
10. **Render, refine, and record.** Inspect at the target size and a reduced thumbnail. Remove one unnecessary element, correct one ambiguity, and retain the design decision that works. Record source/rights, assumptions, checks, reviewer, and unresolved `NOT_ASSESSED` items.

## Decision Rules

| Condition | Action | Wrong-choice failure |
|---|---|---|
| The reader must compare exact magnitudes | Use position or length on a common scale; add direct labels | Pictograms or area imply false precision |
| The story is a process or mechanism | Use a numbered sequence or diagram with directional cues | A decorative collage hides causality |
| The audience needs a memorable entry point | Add one restrained metaphor or human detail that preserves the data | Novelty becomes the subject and the conclusion disappears |
| Data is uncertain, incomplete, or estimated | Show range, missingness, definition, and confidence in plain language | A clean icon or single number implies certainty |
| The topic involves harm, grief, inequality, illness, or trauma | Use warmth and clarity without jokes, caricature, gamification, or sensational contrast | Humour trivialises the subject or damages trust |
| The output will be read on mobile or shared as an image | Create a mobile composition or split sequence; preserve type size and text alternative | Shrinking the desktop poster makes it unreadable |
| A visual choice cannot be explained by audience, message, or medium | Remove it or mark it as an experiment | Decoration masquerades as design |

## Capability Contract

- Read and search are required for the brief, evidence, existing brand system, and source/rights record.
- Calculation or data inspection is required when quantities are encoded.
- Editing and rendering are required for production; accessibility inspection includes keyboard or reading order where applicable, text alternatives, contrast, and greyscale/CVD checks.
- Network access is required only for authorised current-source or asset/licence verification. Publication, paid distribution, or third-party contact needs separate authority.

## Degraded Mode

- Without validated data, produce a labelled storyboard or visual specification, never a factual infographic.
- Without rendering, provide source, dimensions, type scale, checks, and a `NOT_ASSESSED` visual review; do not call the artifact finished.
- Without licensed assets or font evidence, use placeholders or an approved available baseline and mark rights `NOT_ASSESSED`.
- Without accessibility tooling, provide the text-equivalent narrative and a manual checklist, then block release of accessibility-critical work until checked.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Poster-shaped data dump.** Fix: choose one conclusion and demote or remove everything else.
- **Decorative pictograms used as a measurement scale.** Fix: encode comparison with a truthful chart and use illustration only for orientation or metaphor.
- **Rainbow, red/green-only, or colour-only meaning.** Fix: use a tested semantic scale plus labels, shapes, patterns, or line styles.
- **Humour pasted onto a serious subject.** Fix: use approachable language and humane spacing without comedy.
- **Unlabelled estimates, cropped baselines, or missing denominators.** Fix: show units, period, base, uncertainty, and source beside the claim.
- **AI-generated sameness: gradient, card grid, generic icons, and stock imagery.** Fix: define a visual thesis and make three defensible authored choices before production.
- **One desktop canvas mechanically shrunk for every channel.** Fix: recompose for print, presentation, mobile, and social with a text alternative.

## Outputs

| Artefact | Consumer | Evidence and acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|
| Infographic or visual explainer | Intended reader or publisher | One takeaway is visible, the data is truthful, the reading path is clear, and the target render is reviewed |
| Storyboard and visual decision record | Designer, analyst, or AI production tool | Metaphor, chart/diagram choice, hierarchy, type, colour, rights, and accessibility decisions are explicit |
| Text-equivalent and source note | Accessibility reviewer and downstream publisher | All material content, units, uncertainty, and provenance remain available without the graphic |

## Evidence Produced

- Brief and visual thesis.
- Data/source/rights register with durable book concepts separated from current claims.
- Chart/diagram selection and encoding record.
- Render, accessibility, responsive, greyscale, and reader-path checks.
- Reviewer observation, unresolved gaps, rollback or recovery action, and re-audit date.
