description: Use when designing the non-happy-path UI states of any component, screen, or
  flow — empty/zero states, first-run and onboarding-empty, error and failure states
  (inline, page-level, partial/component, offline, permission-denied, 404/500), loading
  states (skeletons, spinners, progressive/streaming, optimistic UI), and success/confirmation
  states. Triggers on "empty state", "error state", "loading skeleton", "spinner", "zero
  data", "blank slate", "no results", "failed to load", "retry", "offline UX", "perceived
  performance", or any review/QA/audit of a component's full state coverage. This skill owns
  the VISUAL and INTERACTION design of states; pairs with the content skill
  `error-empty-and-system-messaging`, which owns the words.

# Empty, Error & Loading States — States as First-Class Design

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- Designing or reviewing the **full state set** of any component, screen, or flow — not just
  the "happy" filled state. The default-filled mock is the *least* common thing a real user
  sees; empty, loading, partial, and error states are what they hit on day one and on bad days.
- Designing a specific non-happy state: **empty/zero** (no data yet, first-run, cleared,
  filtered-to-nothing), **error** (network, server, validation summary, permission, not-found,
  offline), **loading** (skeleton, spinner, progressive/streaming, optimistic), or
  **success/confirmation**.
- Treating **perceived performance** as a design problem — skeletons vs spinners, when to show
  what, how long before you show anything at all.
- Building a **state matrix** for a component spec, handoff sheet, or QA gate.

## Do Not Use When

- You only need the **wording** of an error/empty/system message (the formula, tone, the apology
  vs. blame question) — that is the paired content skill
  `10-content-design-and-ux-writing/error-empty-and-system-messaging`. Use it for copy; use
  THIS skill for the layout, illustration, motion, skeleton geometry, and interaction.
- You are designing **form-field-level** validation and inline error affordances inside a form —
  start at `04-web-and-ui-design/form-ux-design` (it owns field anatomy; come here for the
  page-level error summary and the form's loading/success states).
- The work is purely **Core Web Vitals budgeting / Lighthouse gating** with no state design —
  use `00-cross-cutting-ops-qa-a11y/performance-as-ux-and-core-web-vitals`.

## Required Inputs

- The **component or flow** being designed and its data source (sync? async? paginated?
  streamed? user-generated?). Async + user-generated = the richest state set.
- Which states are **reachable** for this component (run the state matrix in
  `references/state-matrix.md` to enumerate them — do not guess).
- The **brand's illustration/voice system** (or a note that none exists yet), the type scale,
  and the semantic colour roles for info/success/warning/danger so states are *authored*, not
  bolted on with stock clip-art and a generic spinner.
- Latency reality: rough p50/p95 load times per data source — this decides skeleton vs spinner
  vs instant, and whether optimistic UI is safe.

## Workflow

1. **Enumerate every state before designing any.** Run `references/state-matrix.md` against the
   component: ideal, empty (and its sub-types), partial, loading (and its sub-types), error
   (and its sub-types), success. A state you didn't enumerate is a state you'll ship broken.
   This step is the whole point — states are designed *up front*, as siblings of the happy path,
   never patched in after.
2. **Design the empty/zero state as an opportunity, not a void.** First-run empty is your best
   onboarding moment: explain the value, show *one* primary action, and prefer an authored
   illustration or a real preview over a sad-face icon. Distinguish the four empties (first-use,
   user-cleared, no-results-from-filter, error-disguised-as-empty) — they need different copy
   and different actions. Anti-slop: never the generic centered grey magnifying-glass.
3. **Design loading for perceived performance, not honesty.** Apply the latency tiers in
   `references/state-matrix.md` §Loading. Use **skeleton screens** that mirror the real layout's
   geometry (so there is zero layout shift when content arrives — protects CLS, per
   `doctrine/references/web-performance-budgets-2026.md`), not centered spinners, for content
   regions. Spinners only for short, indeterminate, in-place actions (a button submit). Below
   ~100 ms show nothing; show a skeleton only past the perception threshold so fast loads don't
   flash. Stream/progressively reveal where the data allows. Skeletons must animate subtly
   (shimmer/pulse) and honour `prefers-reduced-motion` (WCAG 2.3.3,
   `doctrine/references/wcag-2.2-criteria.md`).
4. **Design errors as recoverable, scoped, and honest.** Match the error's **blast radius** to
   its UI: a failed widget shows a *component-level* error (the rest of the page still works);
   a failed page shows a page-level error; never blow up the whole screen for one dead widget.
   Every error state carries a **recovery affordance** (Retry, Go back, Contact) and preserves
   the user's work. Pair colour with an icon and text — never colour alone (WCAG 1.4.1). Offline
   and permission-denied are distinct error states with distinct actions.
5. **Design success/confirmation deliberately.** Decide: silent (optimistic, the change is its
   own confirmation), inline (a toast/checkmark that auto-dismisses), or a full confirmation
   screen (irreversible/high-stakes actions). Success motion is a reward — keep it brief,
   purposeful, reduced-motion-safe. Avoid the celebratory-confetti reflex unless the moment
   truly earns it.
6. **Verify against the gates.** Target size ≥24px on every state's interactive control
   (WCAG 2.5.8); focus moves sensibly when a state swaps (don't strand the keyboard user on a
   removed node, 2.4.3); live regions announce loading/error/success to screen readers (4.1.3);
   no layout shift between skeleton and loaded; reduced-motion path exists.

## Quality Standards

- Every state is **authored** — illustrations, copy, and motion that belong to *this* product,
  not a default centered icon + "No data" + grey spinner (see `doctrine/design-doctrine.md`,
  the Anti-Slop Charter). When two empty states are equally clean, ship the one a templating
  tool would never produce.
- **Zero layout shift** between loading and loaded: skeleton geometry matches real content.
- **No dead ends**: every empty and every error offers a next action and preserves user work.
- **Accessible in every state**, not just the filled one (contrast, focus, target size, live
  regions, reduced motion).

## Anti-Patterns

- **Designing only the happy/filled state** and treating the rest as engineering's problem.
  This is the single most common cause of broken-looking shipped UI.
- **Spinner for everything**, including content regions and long loads (no layout preview,
  feels slower, causes CLS when content pops in).
- **Skeleton that doesn't match the real layout** — content jumps on arrival; you've added CLS
  while trying to look fast.
- **The generic empty state**: centered grey magnifying glass + "No results" + nothing to do.
- **Error states that destroy work**, blame the user, or nuke the whole screen for one failed
  widget. Vague "Something went wrong" with no retry and no scope.
- **Colour-only state signalling** (red border, no icon, no text) — fails WCAG 1.4.1 and
  colour-blind users.
- **Flashing a loader for a 60 ms load**, or showing a skeleton then a spinner then content
  (state thrash). Honour the perception threshold.
- **Ignoring `prefers-reduced-motion`** on shimmer/pulse/success animations.

## Outputs

- A complete **per-component state matrix** (every reachable state enumerated and designed).
- **Designed specs** for each state: empty (per sub-type), loading (skeleton geometry + tier
  rationale), error (per scope + recovery affordance), success (chosen pattern).
- Skeleton layout maps that guarantee no layout shift.
- A11y notes per state (focus handling, live-region announcements, target size, reduced motion).
- Handoff-ready acceptance criteria a developer and QA can check off.

## Examples

- See `examples/states-for-a-table-component.md` — every state of one real component (a paginated
  data table) designed end to end: ideal, first-run empty, no-results-from-filter, loading
  skeleton, partial/streaming, row-level and page-level error, offline, and success. Includes
  skeleton geometry, recovery affordances, motion, and the a11y notes for each.

## References

- `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` — the Mission and the Anti-Slop Charter; states must look
  authored, never a defaulted spinner-and-sad-icon.
- `doctrine/references/web-performance-budgets-2026.md` — **skeletons over spinners**, perceived
  performance, and CLS (≤0.1): loading-state design is a Core-Web-Vitals lever, and skeleton
  geometry that prevents layout shift protects the CLS budget directly.
- `doctrine/references/wcag-2.2-criteria.md` — target size 24px (2.5.8), focus order on state
  swaps (2.4.3), reduced motion (2.3.3), colour-not-alone (1.4.1), live regions (4.1.3) for each
  state.
- `doctrine/references/ai-slop-taxonomy.md` — the convergent defaults (centered grey spinner,
  generic "No data" empty) this skill exists to replace.
- This skill's `references/state-matrix.md` — the enumerable set of states every component needs.
- Paired content skill `10-content-design-and-ux-writing/error-empty-and-system-messaging` —
  owns the **words** of each state; consult it for copy while this skill owns the visual/
  interaction design.
- Sibling `04-web-and-ui-design/form-ux-design` — field-level validation; this skill owns the
  page-level error summary and the form's loading/success states.
