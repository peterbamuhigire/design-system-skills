description: Use when you must RUN a human design critique or design-review session (live or async)
  and want it to be productive, safe, and decisive — framing the ask, choosing a feedback framework
  (I-like / I-wish / what-if; problem-not-solution; ladder of feedback), separating taste from
  requirement, naming the single decider, capturing decisions, and protecting psychological safety.
  Triggers — "run a design critique", "facilitate a design review", "design crit", "feedback
  session", "review meeting for this design", "how do I give/structure design feedback", "crit
  protocol", "who decides in the review", "design feedback is unstructured / hurts / goes in
  circles", "async design review", "capture the decisions from the crit". This is the FACILITATION
  of the human session; for an expert artifact evaluation use `heuristic-evaluation-and-design-critique`
  or `design-audit` (those EVALUATE; this one FACILITATES the room).

# Design Critique & Review Facilitation

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- You have to **run the meeting**, not just have an opinion — a live or async design critique /
  design review where several people will react to a concrete piece of work and a decision must
  come out the other end.
- Feedback in your reviews is **unstructured, demoralising, or goes in circles** — people argue
  preferences, the loudest voice wins, the author leaves bruised, and nothing is actually decided.
- You need a **repeatable session protocol**: how to frame the ask, which feedback framework to
  use, how to separate *taste* from *requirement*, who decides, and how the decisions get recorded.
- You are setting up an **async review** (PR-style comments, a Figma thread, a recorded walkthrough)
  and need the same rigour without everyone in a room at once.
- You want the critique to **protect the maker** (psychological safety) *while still being honest* —
  the two are not in tension when the session is run well.

## Do Not Use When

- You want an **expert evaluation of the artifact itself** — a structured walkthrough against
  Nielsen/Tognazzini heuristics with per-finding severities → use
  `heuristic-evaluation-and-design-critique`. That skill **produces the findings**; this one
  **runs the human session** in which findings (and taste calls) are discussed and decided.
- You want a **scored 0–100 quality audit** across 10 dimensions → use `design-audit`. (Audit =
  one expert's graded scan; critique = a facilitated group session. They feed each other: an audit
  can be an *input* to a crit, but the crit is where humans decide what to do about it.)
- You need a **ship go/no-go gate** with spec/pixel parity and signed verdict →
  `design-qa-and-pre-launch-review`.
- There is **nothing concrete to react to** yet — only an idea in someone's head. Build the smallest
  real demo first; a critique with no artifact is the "imaginary-puppy" anti-pattern
  (`doctrine/references/creative-selection-and-taste.md`). Return when there is a demo.

## Required Inputs

- **A concrete artifact to react to** — a working demo, screens, a prototype, a flow, or a redline.
  Never run a crit on a verbal description or a mock-of-a-mock (creative-selection rule 1: *the
  working demo is the unit of progress*). The closer to real, the better the feedback.
- **The author's framed ask** — what *stage* the work is at, what *one or two questions* the author
  wants answered, and what is explicitly **off the table** for this round (locked decisions,
  out-of-scope). An unframed crit invites scattershot feedback on things already decided.
- **The decision model** — who is the **single decider** for this work, and what is merely advisory.
  Reviews without a named decider end in mush (Kocienda: every review has *one* decider).
- **Mode** — live (synchronous) or async — and the **roster** (author, facilitator, reviewers; keep
  it small — 3–6 reviewers, not the whole org).
- **Where decisions will be captured** — the doc/ticket/thread that becomes the record.

## Workflow

Run the session in seven moves. The full protocol (timings, scripts, framework choice) is in
`references/critique-protocol.md`; an end-to-end worked session is in
`examples/critique-session-worked.md`.

1. **Set the frame (before any feedback).** The facilitator states the goal of the session and the
   author states the ask: the stage, the **1–2 questions** they want answered, the audience/context
   of the work, and **what is locked / out of scope**. Write the ask at the top of the capture doc.
   A tight frame is the single biggest lever on crit quality — it turns "what do you think?" (which
   yields taste noise) into "does this onboarding reduce drop-off for first-time users?" (which
   yields useful signal).
2. **Present the artifact, not the rationale-as-defence.** The author walks the *concrete demo*
   briefly, then **stops defending and starts listening**. Reviewers react to the artifact in front
   of them, not to an imagined one. (No artifact ⇒ no crit — send it back to be built.)
3. **Choose and announce a feedback framework.** Pick the one that fits the stage and say which it
   is, so everyone gives feedback in the same shape (`references/critique-protocol.md` §Frameworks):
   - **I-like / I-wish / what-if** — early/exploratory work; keeps it generative and safe.
   - **Problem, not solution** — name the *problem you observed* and leave the fix to the author
     ("users can't tell which field failed", not "make the border red"). Protects authorship.
   - **Ladder of feedback** (clarify → value → concerns → suggestions) — climbs from understanding
     to critique so concerns land *after* the work is understood, not before.
4. **Separate taste from requirement — out loud, every time.** Tag each piece of feedback as either
   a **requirement** (it violates an objective standard — a11y AA, a broken red-route, a stated
   brand rule, a measured perf budget: an *algorithm*, the arrow points one way) or a **taste call**
   (a heuristic with a real value but no objective arrow — a colour, a duration, a word). This is the
   algorithm-vs-heuristic lens from `doctrine/references/creative-selection-and-taste.md`. Requirements
   are non-negotiable and go straight to the decision log; taste calls are *input to the decider*,
   **never** settled by vote, volume, or seniority. ("I'd have used another font" is taste; "this
   label fails 4.5:1 contrast" is requirement. Saying which prevents taste being smuggled in as fact.)
5. **Name the decider and decide — on the spot where possible.** After the input, the **single
   decider** makes the calls. Taste decisions trace to a skilled human's conviction, not to a tally
   and not to an A/B metric (the "41 shades of blue" lesson — do not outsource a taste decision to a
   number). Decisiveness is the job; a crit that defers everything was theatre.
6. **Capture decisions, not just comments.** For every open question record one of: **decided**
   (what + who + why, one line), **author's call** (owner + by-when), **needs a demo/spike** (the
   variation to build before the next round), or **parked** (with the reason). Comments evaporate;
   the **decision log is the deliverable**. See `references/critique-protocol.md` §Capture.
7. **Close the loop with "live on it" where it's a heuristic.** Some calls can't be settled in one
   review — an animation's feel, whether the flow "adds up". Mark these to be **dogfooded over time**
   ("live on it"), not re-litigated by reopening the same argument
   (`doctrine/references/creative-selection-and-taste.md` rule 2). Schedule the next demo, not the
   next debate.

**Async variant.** The same seven moves apply, time-shifted: the frame + ask is written at the top
of the thread; reviewers comment in the chosen framework's shape and **tag each comment
[requirement] / [taste]**; the decider resolves each thread with a decision tag; the captured log is
the thread's summary. Async trades immediacy for a written record and wider time zones — see
`references/critique-protocol.md` §Live-vs-async for which to choose.

## Anti-Patterns

- **No artifact in the room.** Critiquing a description or a mock-of-a-mock — "arguing about whose
  imaginary puppy is cuter." Build the smallest real demo first
  (`doctrine/references/creative-selection-and-taste.md`).
- **Unframed "what do you think?"** With no ask and no out-of-scope, the crit sprays opinions over
  settled decisions and wastes the room. Frame first, always.
- **Taste smuggled in as requirement.** "That's just wrong" about a colour/word/duration, stated as
  fact. Tag it as taste and route it to the decider; reserve "requirement" for objective standards.
- **Decision by vote, volume, or seniority.** Letting the loudest or most senior voice settle a
  *taste* call, or counting hands. Taste traces to the decider's conviction, not a tally
  (the "41 blues" error on the process side).
- **Feedback aimed at the person, not the work.** "You always do this" / praise-sandwich theatre.
  Critique the artifact; protect the maker (see Psychological-safety, `references/critique-protocol.md`).
- **The author defends instead of listening.** Turning the crit into a debate the author "wins" kills
  the signal. The author asks clarifying questions, captures, and decides later.
- **Comments captured, decisions not.** Leaving a pile of notes and no record of what was *decided*,
  by whom, and why — so the same argument reopens next week.
- **Seagull feedback.** A senior who swoops in, drops opinions, and leaves without engaging the
  context or owning a decision (Kocienda's *Seagull Manager* failure mode).
- **Re-litigating a heuristic instead of living on it.** Re-arguing a feel-call every meeting rather
  than dogfooding it over time and re-deciding from real use.

## Outputs

- A **run session** (live or async) that produced **decisions, not just comments**.
- A **decision log** — each open question resolved as decided / author's-call / needs-a-demo /
  parked, with owner, one-line rationale, and (for taste calls) the decider named.
- A **requirement list vs. taste-input list** — the objective must-fixes separated from the
  conviction-led calls, so nothing objective is voted away and nothing subjective is faked as fact.
- A **next-step**: the next demo to build (not the next debate to have), and any "live-on-it" items
  to dogfood before re-deciding.

## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Critique facilitation | Critique session record | Markdown: frame/ask, framework used, feedback captured, decision log | `docs/crit/onboarding-crit-2026-06-21.md` |
| Critique facilitation | Decision log | Table: question → decision/owner/why/decider | `docs/crit/onboarding-decisions.md` |
| Critique facilitation | Requirement vs taste split | Two lists: objective must-fix vs decider-input | `docs/crit/onboarding-req-vs-taste.md` |

## Examples

- `examples/critique-session-worked.md` — a full worked critique session of a real artifact (a
  first-time-user onboarding flow demo): the agenda and frame, the author's ask, the feedback
  captured under the chosen framework, the taste-vs-requirement split, the single-decider decisions,
  and the recorded decision log with next-demo. Concrete, not lorem.

## References

- `references/critique-protocol.md` — **the session structure**: agenda + timings, the three
  feedback frameworks (I-like/I-wish/what-if; problem-not-solution; ladder of feedback) and when to
  use each, the taste-vs-requirement split rule, the single-decider + decision-capture model,
  psychological-safety practices, and the live-vs-async decision.
- `doctrine/references/creative-selection-and-taste.md` — **the doctrine spine of this skill**: no
  critique without a concrete demo (rule 1); the **algorithm-vs-heuristic** lens that powers the
  taste-vs-requirement split; the **"41 shades of blue"** lesson (don't outsource a taste decision to
  a vote/metric); **"live on it"** for heuristic calls that can't be settled in one review.
- `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` — the Mission (*the moat is looking human-made*) and the Anti-Slop
  Charter; a crit also surfaces convergent/slop choices, and the rule that taste choices trace to
  **human design authority**, never to a vote or a model's pick.

## Plugins (Load Alongside)

| Companion Skill | When to Load |
|---|---|
| `heuristic-evaluation-and-design-critique` | When the session needs an **expert evaluation as input** — run that to produce severity-rated findings, then bring them into the crit for the team to decide on. (That EVALUATES; this FACILITATES.) |
| `design-audit` | When a **scored diagnostic** of the artifact should seed the discussion — its triage queue is good crit input. |
| `design-qa-and-pre-launch-review` | **Downstream** — once the crit's decisions are built, run the ship gate. |
| `ux-remediation-and-redesign` | **Downstream** — to execute and re-validate the fixes the crit decided on. |

## 1. The method in one paragraph

A design critique is not a vote and not a venue for opinions — it is a **facilitated session in
which a small group reacts to a concrete piece of work so the author and the single decider can make
better, faster decisions**. Its discipline comes from four moves: **a tight frame** (what stage, what
question, what is off the table), **a named feedback framework** (so everyone gives feedback in the
same shape), **separating taste from requirement** (objective standards are non-negotiable; taste
calls are the decider's, never the room's vote), and **capturing decisions, not comments**. Run it
this way and honesty and psychological safety stop being in tension: the work is critiqued, the maker
is protected, and the meeting ends with decisions and a next demo rather than a pile of notes and a
bruised author. (Spine: `doctrine/references/creative-selection-and-taste.md` — demo-grounded
critique, the algorithm/heuristic lens, the single decider, and "live on it".)

## 2. How this differs from the EVALUATE pair

| | **Critique facilitation (this skill)** | **`heuristic-evaluation` / `design-audit`** |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | Running the **human session** | Producing an **expert evaluation** of the artifact |
| **Unit** | A meeting / async thread + a decision log | A findings report / a 0–100 score |
| **Who acts** | A facilitator, a small roster, one decider | One (or a few) evaluators against a rubric |
| **Output** | **Decisions**, requirement-vs-taste split, next demo | Severity-rated findings / gated score |
| **Question** | *How do we run this review so it's productive, safe, and decisive?* | *What's wrong with the artifact, and how bad?* |

They compose: an audit or heuristic evaluation can be an **input** that seeds the critique, but the
critique is where humans **discuss and decide**. Keep the boundary — do not re-derive heuristic
findings here; bring them in and facilitate the decision.
