description: Use when a page, screen, flow, or component is "done" and about to ship —
  the final pre-launch QA gate that verifies spec/pixel parity against the design,
  checks cross-device and cross-browser behaviour, and composes the anti-slop +
  accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA) + performance (Core Web Vitals) gates into ONE go/no-go
  checklist with a signed verdict. Triggers: "pre-launch review", "ship checklist",
  "QA this page before launch", "design QA", "pixel parity", "matches the Figma/mockup",
  "cross-browser/cross-device check", "is this ready to ship", "launch sign-off",
  "release gate", "did we regress the design", "acceptance review". Composes the
  visual-product-slop-audit, accessibility-wcag-2-2-compliance, and
  performance-as-ux-and-core-web-vitals gates; for a deep diagnostic critique of an
  existing build use design-audit instead.

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- A build is feature-complete and you need the **final go/no-go gate before it ships** —
  one review that fails the launch if any blocking gate fails.
- You need to verify the built UI **matches the approved design** — spec parity (tokens,
  type scale, spacing, components, states, copy) and pixel parity against the mockup/Figma.
- You need to confirm the page **holds up across devices and browsers** — the small-phone /
  tablet / desktop / large-screen breakpoints and the Chromium / WebKit / Firefox engines.
- You are shipping an Apple-platform surface and need iOS/iPadOS/macOS checks for Liquid Glass,
  SF Symbols 8, Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, Reduce Transparency, iPhone resizability, iPad
  multitasking, Mac-designed-for-iPhone, TestFlight screenshots, or Safari/WebKit behavior.
- You want the **anti-slop, accessibility, and performance gates rolled into a single
  checklist** with a recorded verdict and sign-off, rather than three separate passes that
  nobody reconciles.
- You are doing release acceptance and need an auditable artifact (filled QA review) that
  says exactly what passed, what blocks launch, and who signed off.

## Do Not Use When

- You want a **deep diagnostic critique** of an existing interface (10-dimension scored
  audit with prioritized remediation) — use `design-audit`. This skill is a pass/fail ship
  gate, not an exploratory critique; it *invokes* the audits as gates.
- You only need **one dimension**: the slop check → `visual-product-slop-audit`; WCAG
  conformance → `accessibility-wcag-2-2-compliance`; Core Web Vitals/budgets →
  `performance-as-ux-and-core-web-vitals`. This skill composes all three for the *ship*
  decision; use the single skill when that one gate is the whole job.
- The work is **early design** (no build to QA yet) — there is nothing to check parity
  against. Return when there is a build.
- The deliverable is a **static document** (DOCX/PDF) — cross-browser/CWV do not apply;
  use the group-13 document skills, which carry their own export checks.

## Required Inputs

- The **built artifact** (a running URL, a staging build, or screenshots per breakpoint)
  AND the **approved design** to check it against (Figma frames, redlines, or the design
  spec). Parity needs both sides — refuse to certify parity from one side alone.
- The **page archetype** (marketing/landing, web-app shell, document/long-form) — selects
  the performance budget row in `web-performance-budgets-2026.md`.
- The **target matrix**: which devices/viewport widths and which browser engines are in
  scope (default to the matrix in `references/pre-launch-qa-checklist.md` §Cross-device).
- The **conformance target** (default WCAG 2.2 **AA**; note any AAA commitments).
- Whether the **slop, a11y, and perf gates have already been run** — if so, attach their
  results; if not, this review runs each gate inline by delegating to its owning skill.
- The **launch owner** who signs the verdict.

## Workflow

1. **Open the checklist and record the header.** Start from
   `references/pre-launch-qa-checklist.md`. Record date, target (page/flow), archetype,
   build URL/commit, the design source, the device+browser matrix, and the launch owner.
   Template: `examples/qa-review-filled.md`.
2. **Spec parity — does the build match the design system, not just the picture?** Walk the
   spec-parity section: design tokens (colour, type scale, spacing) resolve to the system,
   not hard-coded one-offs; the **type scale and pairing** follow `type-scale-and-spacing.md`
   and `pairing-principles.md`; every interactive element ships its full **state set**
   (default/hover/focus/active/disabled/loading/error/success); microcopy matches the
   approved strings (verb+noun buttons, real error/empty copy). Flag any drift.
3. **Pixel parity — does it match the mockup at the reference breakpoint?** Overlay or
   side-by-side the build against the design frame at the canonical width. Check spacing
   rhythm, alignment axes, component dimensions, and that nothing "settled" differently than
   designed. Intentional, documented deviations are fine; undocumented ones are findings.
4. **Run the anti-slop gate (composed).** Invoke `visual-product-slop-audit` over the built
   screens and `ai-slop-typography-audit` over the type. Confirm: no banned default font
   (`ai-slop-banned-fonts.md`), the type/colour/layout choice was **stated** per the Mission,
   and no visual or product slop tells survived into the build. **This gate is binary —
   any FAIL blocks launch.** Record PASS/FAIL with the tell cited.
5. **Run the accessibility gate (composed).** Invoke `accessibility-wcag-2-2-compliance`
   against `doctrine/references/wcag-2.2-criteria.md`. Verify the perennial AA floor
   (contrast ≥ 4.5:1 body / ≥ 3:1 large+UI; keyboard operable with logical visible focus;
   name/role/value; alt text; reflow at 320px + 200% zoom; reduced-motion) **and** the nine
   WCAG 2.2 deltas (focus-not-obscured 2.4.11; target size ≥ 24px 2.5.8; dragging
   alternative 2.5.7; consistent help; redundant entry; accessible authentication). Run it
   the way the ref demands: automated (axe/Lighthouse) **plus** manual keyboard traversal
   **plus** a screen-reader smoke test — automation alone catches only ~30–40%. **Any AA
   failure is a launch blocker.**
6. **Run the performance gate (composed).** Invoke
   `performance-as-ux-and-core-web-vitals` against
   `doctrine/references/web-performance-budgets-2026.md`. Confirm field/lab CWV in the *good*
   band (LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1) and that the page is within the archetype's
   JS/CSS/image/font/total KB budget. A page over budget or out of the good band **fails the
   gate** — wire the budget as Lighthouse-CI thresholds so this is enforced on every build.
7. **Cross-device check.** Walk every viewport in the matrix (small phone 320–360px →
   large desktop). Verify no horizontal scroll, no clipped/overlapping content, touch
   targets ≥ 24px (aim 44px touch), readable type, and that the **responsive intent** (not
   just "it doesn't break") survives. See `references/pre-launch-qa-checklist.md` §Cross-device.
8. **Cross-browser check.** Verify on the in-scope engines — **Chromium** (Chrome/Edge),
   **WebKit** (Safari, incl. iOS Safari), and **Firefox/Gecko**. Watch the usual divergences:
   focus-ring rendering, form-control styling, `backdrop-filter`/`gap`/container-query
   support, font rendering/metrics, and date/number input. Record per-engine pass.
9. **Apple-platform visual QA when in scope.** Verify Liquid Glass chrome, SF Symbols 8, Dynamic
   Type AX sizes, Reduce Transparency, Increase Contrast, Reduce Motion, Dark Mode, appearance
   personalization, app icon variants, iPhone resizability, iPad multitasking, and
   Mac-designed-for-iPhone windows. Record device, OS, SDK, and build evidence.
10. **Tally and sign the verdict.** Roll the checklist into a single verdict: **SHIP** (all
   blocking gates PASS), **SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS** (only non-blocking lows remain, logged with
   owners), or **NO-SHIP** (any blocker open — list each blocker with its gate and fix).
   The launch owner signs. A blocker on slop, a11y-AA, or perf-budget **always** forces
   NO-SHIP — convenience never overrides (`doctrine/design-doctrine.md` Mission).

## Quality Standards

- Parity is checked against **both** the build and the approved design — never certified
  from one side. Every deviation is either documented-intentional or a finding.
- The three composed gates are **actually run** (or attached with fresh results), not
  assumed. Slop, a11y-AA, and perf-budget are blocking; the verdict reflects that.
- Accessibility is verified with automation **plus** manual keyboard **plus** screen-reader —
  a green Lighthouse score alone is not a pass.
- Apple-platform release checks record actual device/simulator evidence, not only a desktop browser resize.
- Every blocker in the verdict names its gate, its standard, and a specific fix.

## Anti-Patterns

- **"Looks fine to me" sign-off.** Eyeballing one browser at desktop width and shipping —
  the gate exists precisely to stop that.
- **Pixel parity without spec parity.** Matching the screenshot while hard-coding values
  that should resolve to tokens — it drifts on the next change.
- **Treating Lighthouse green as the whole a11y gate.** Automation misses ~60%; skipping
  the keyboard and screen-reader passes ships inaccessible UI that "passed".
- **Letting a deadline override a blocker.** Shipping a known slop/AA/budget failure "for
  now" — the Mission outranks convenience; that is a NO-SHIP.
- **Re-deriving thresholds.** Inventing contrast ratios or CWV numbers instead of citing
  the canonical `wcag-2.2-criteria.md` and `web-performance-budgets-2026.md`.
- **Duplicating the audits.** Re-writing the slop/a11y/perf logic here instead of invoking
  the owning skills — this skill *composes* them into a ship gate, it does not fork them.
- **No recorded verdict.** A QA pass with no signed artifact leaves no audit trail.

## Outputs

- A **filled pre-launch QA review** (`examples/qa-review-filled.md` shape): header, spec-
  and pixel-parity findings, the three composed gate verdicts (slop / a11y-AA / perf), the
  cross-device and cross-browser matrices, and a single signed **SHIP / SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS
  / NO-SHIP** verdict.
- A **blocker list** — each with its gate, the standard it violates, and the fix.
- A **follow-ups log** — non-blocking lows with owners, for SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS.
- The **Lighthouse-CI / axe build-gate lines** to keep the gates enforced post-launch.

## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Pre-ship QA | Pre-launch QA review | Markdown checklist with composed gate verdicts + signed go/no-go | `docs/qa/pre-launch-checkout.md` |
| Pre-ship QA | Cross-device/browser matrix | Pass/fail grid per viewport × engine | `docs/qa/device-browser-matrix.md` |
| Pre-ship QA | Blocker + follow-up log | Findings with gate, standard, fix, owner | `docs/qa/launch-blockers.md` |

## Examples

- `examples/qa-review-filled.md` — a fully filled pre-launch review of a sample page (a
  checkout page): spec + pixel parity findings, the composed slop / WCAG-2.2-AA / Core-Web-
  Vitals gate verdicts, the cross-device and cross-browser matrices, the blocker list, and a
  signed NO-SHIP → (after fixes) SHIP verdict. Not lorem — concrete, with real thresholds.

  a11y / perf blocker forces NO-SHIP and that convenience never overrides.
