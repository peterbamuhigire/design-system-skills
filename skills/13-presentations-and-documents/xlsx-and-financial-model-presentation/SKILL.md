description: Use when an Excel/.xlsx spreadsheet, financial model, KPI sheet, or analytical exhibit must be PRESENTED as a designed, exhibit-grade artifact — number formats that read as authored (custom masks, accounting negatives, $-on-top-and-totals), conditional formatting used as deliberate visual encoding (data bars / icon sets / colour scales with non-colour cues), named table & cell styles, the blue-input/black-formula model convention, charts styled for integrity, and print/page layout for hand-out exhibits. Triggers on "make this model/spreadsheet look presentable", "format this Excel exhibit/KPI sheet", "number formats for a financial model", "conditional formatting heatmap/data bars", "print this model summary as an exhibit", or any .xlsx that must not open as default Calibri grey-grid. Does NOT cover formulas, pivots, macros, or model calculation logic — those defer to the finance/engineering engines.

## Use When

- A spreadsheet — financial model summary, KPI dashboard sheet, schedule, sensitivity table,
  budget-vs-actual, cohort/ageing table — must be **presented** as a considered, institutional
  exhibit rather than a default Calibri grey-grid worksheet.
- The sheet needs **exhibit-grade number formatting** (custom masks, three-part
  `positive;negative;zero`, accounting parentheses + red negatives, the `$`-on-top-row-and-totals
  convention, units in the format, consistent decimals) so the numbers read as authored.
- You want **conditional formatting used as deliberate visual encoding** — data bars, icon sets,
  colour scales / heatmaps — chosen to match magnitude vs threshold vs category, used with
  restraint, paired with a legend and a **non-colour cue**.
- The model needs the **blue-input / black-formula** readability convention, a named **table &
  cell-style system**, gridlines off, never-hide-rows discipline, and `Center Across Selection`
  instead of merged cells.
- An embedded **chart** must be styled for integrity (zero baseline, no 3-D, no stacked-line-as-
  trend, actual-vs-projected colour with a second cue), or the workbook must be laid out for
  **print as a hand-out exhibit** (print area, fit-to-page floor, centre-on-page, header/footer,
  tab colour-coding).
- The deliverable is an `.xlsx` (or a printed/PDF exhibit *from* one) — not a slide, not a Word
  report, not a web dashboard.

## Do Not Use When

- **The work is formula / calculation / pivot / macro / model MECHANICS** — building the model
  logic, writing formulas, structuring pivots, dynamic arrays, XLOOKUP, Power Query, data
  validation, what-if/Solver/Goal-Seek, scenario engines, VBA/Office-Scripts automation, or the
  *accounting correctness* of the numbers. **This skill owns only how the model is dressed and
  presented; it explicitly defers all calculation and modelling mechanics** to the finance engine
  (`C:\wamp64\www\chwezi-accounting-doctrine`, for IFRS/IAS statement structure, statutory and
  bookkeeping correctness) and to the engineering catalog (`~/.claude/skills`) for spreadsheet
  engineering / automation. If the request is "build/fix the model", route there first; return
  here only to present the result.
- The file must be **created or programmatically read/written** as a build task (open, parse, emit
  `.xlsx`/`.csv` via a library) — use the `xlsx` document skill for the tooling; come here for the
  *design* settings it should apply.
- The **chart's encoding choice itself** (which chart, perceptual ranking, dashboard page
  composition) is the question — that is `12-data-viz-and-dashboards/data-visualization` (the
  individual chart) and `dashboard-and-data-product-design` (the page). This skill applies those
  rules *inside Excel*; it does not restate the chart-choice theory.
- The deliverable is a **Word report** (`docx-report-and-document-formatting`), a **slide deck**
  (`deck-system`), or a **branded PDF proposal** (`pdf-proposal-and-bankable-document-design`).
- **No typeface / palette has been chosen** — state it first via `font-selection-and-pairing`
  (group 01) and the doctrine charter, then return here.

## Required Inputs

- The sheet's purpose, audience, and medium (on-screen review vs printed board hand-out vs PDF
  exhibit) — this sets decimals, density, and whether a print layout is warranted.
- The data's structure: which cells are **hard-coded inputs/assumptions** vs **formula outputs**
  vs **totals** (needed to apply the blue/black convention and the `$`-row convention), and the
  units/scale (actuals, thousands, millions, %, ratios, days).
- A stated type + palette choice per the charter: a **04 Technical / Data** face for the numeric
  body (tabular/lining figures), an accent colour for emphasis, and a colour-blind-safe scale for
  any conditional encoding — never a banned default, never red+green as the only signal.
- For charts/print: the comparison the chart must make, and the trim/orientation for the exhibit.

## Workflow

1. **State the type, palette, and encoding intent first.** Per the Anti-Slop Charter
   (`doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §2), name the numeric face (a **04 Technical / Data** family with
   **tabular lining figures** so columns align — e.g. IBM Plex Mono / IBM Plex Sans for headers, or
   a workhorse with tabular figures from `doctrine/references/font-groups-and-usage.md`), the single
   accent colour, and — if you will encode with conditional formatting — *which* signal (magnitude /
   threshold / category) and the colour-blind-safe scale, **before** touching the sheet. Scan
   `fonts/04-technical-data-code/` for a purchased family and prefer it when it improves the result.
   Never default to Calibri/Aptos (the slop signal of an unconsidered workbook).
2. **Set exhibit-grade number formats.** Apply the custom-mask system in
   `references/xlsx-design-system.md`: required-vs-optional digits (`0` vs `#`), thousands
   separators, the **three-part `positive;negative;zero`** mask, **accounting parentheses + red for
   negatives**, the **`$` (or currency) on the top data row and on totals only** (blank or aligned
   elsewhere to cut noise), units in the format (`0.0 "x"`, `0 "days"`, `0.0%%` for points), date
   masks (`mmm yyyy`), and one consistent decimal count per column. Consistency is the
   professionalism signal — do not let a column mix 2-dp and 0-dp.
3. **Apply the table & cell-style system.** Per `references/xlsx-design-system.md`: define named
   **cell styles** (Input, Formula/Calc, Total, Header, Note) carrying the **blue font = hard-coded
   input/assumption, black = formula** convention; use **`Center Across Selection`** (not Merge) for
   spanning titles so navigation/copy/sort stay intact; turn **gridlines off** and use deliberate
   hairline rules and banded shading instead; align numbers right with consistent padding; **never
   hide rows** to make an exhibit (group/collapse instead — the Lehman/Barclays cautionary tale).
4. **Use conditional formatting AS visual encoding — with restraint and a non-colour cue.** Per
   `references/xlsx-design-system.md`: pick the mechanism by signal — **data bars** for in-cell
   magnitude (a sorted-bar surrogate; show the number too, set a sensible max), **colour scales /
   heatmaps** for a continuous field across a matrix (single-hue ramp, not rainbow; tinted
   endpoints), **icon sets** for threshold/RAG status (always pair the icon with text/number — a
   shape is itself the non-colour cue). One encoding per table; add a legend; honour WCAG 1.4.1
   (never colour-alone) and the 3:1 / 4.5:1 contrast floors (`doctrine/references/wcag-2.2-criteria.md`).
   Use **blue + orange** (or tint + sign), never red+green as the sole distinction.
5. **Style any embedded chart for integrity.** Apply `references/xlsx-design-system.md` chart rules
   (which inherit `12-data-viz-and-dashboards/data-visualization`): **zero baseline on bars**, **no
   3-D**, **no stacked-line-as-trend**, distinct **actual-vs-projected** treatment carrying a second
   cue (solid vs dashed, not colour alone), direct labels over distant legends, thin light gridlines
   or none, grey base + one accent, an **action title**. Defer the *choice* of chart and the
   perceptual ranking to that sibling; here you only apply it in Excel.
6. **Lay out for print / PDF exhibit (when it will be handed out).** Per
   `references/exhibit-and-print-layout.md`: set an explicit **print area** (and named multi-block
   areas), use **Page Break Preview**, scale to fit **with a legibility floor** (never shrink below
   ~8 pt effective — split the exhibit instead), **centre on page**, set repeating header rows
   (`Print Titles`), a header/footer (title, source/as-of date, page x of y, confidentiality),
   margins trimmed, and **colour-code worksheet tabs** for navigation. Set a print **palette that
   survives greyscale** (the non-colour cue earns its keep here).
7. **Accessibility & QA pass.** Verify: no colour-only encoding (every CF distinction has a
   shape/sign/label); text and data-mark contrast meet 4.5:1 / 3:1; numeric face has tabular
   figures so columns align; tables have a real header row and simple non-merged structure;
   workbook/sheet titles and a descriptive document title set; alt text on charts/images; one
   consistent decimal and currency convention throughout; gridlines-off exhibit still reads via
   deliberate rules. Then sanity-check that you have **not** strayed into calculation logic — if you
   changed a formula or a number's meaning, stop and route to the finance engine.

## Anti-Patterns

- Shipping the **default Calibri grey-grid**: visible gridlines as the only structure, no number
  formatting, currency repeated on every interior row, mixed decimals down a column — the
  recognisable signature of an unconsidered workbook.
- **Conditional formatting as decoration**: rainbow colour scales, three different CF rules stacked
  on one table, data bars with no number, icon sets carrying RAG status **by colour alone** (fails
  WCAG 1.4.1), traffic-light red+green with no shape or label.
- **Merged cells** for titles/spanning (breaks sort, copy, navigation, and the accessibility tree) —
  use `Center Across Selection`.
- **Hiding rows/columns** to manufacture an exhibit (the Lehman/Barclays footnote) — group/collapse
  or build a dedicated summary sheet instead.
- Losing the **blue-input/black-formula** tell, so a reader cannot see what is an assumption vs a
  result; or hard-coding a number on top of a formula in black.
- **Chart-integrity violations** carried into Excel: non-zero bar baseline, 3-D, stacked-line-as-
  trend, secondary axis used as a puzzle, actual-vs-forecast distinguished by hue alone.
- **Straying into mechanics**: "improving" the model by rewriting formulas, pivots, or the
  accounting — that is the finance/engineering engine's job, not this skill's.
- Fit-to-page shrinking the exhibit into illegibility instead of splitting it.

## Outputs

- An `.xlsx` (and/or a print/PDF exhibit from it) with **exhibit-grade number formats** applied
  consistently (custom masks, accounting negatives, `$`-on-top-and-totals, units, one decimal per
  column).
- A **named table & cell-style system** carrying the **blue-input/black-formula** convention,
  gridlines-off with deliberate rules, `Center Across Selection` titles, never-hidden rows.
- **Conditional formatting used as deliberate encoding** (data bars / icon sets / colour scale)
  chosen to match the signal, restrained, legended, and carrying a **non-colour cue** at AA contrast.
- **Integrity-styled charts** (zero baseline, no 3-D, actual-vs-projected with a second cue, action
  title) and, where handed out, a **print-ready exhibit layout** (print area, fit-floor, centre,
  repeating headers, footer, greyscale-safe palette, tab colour-coding).
- A one-paragraph **choice rationale** (numeric face, accent, and the encoding-signal mapping), per
  the charter — and an explicit note that calculation/model mechanics were deferred to the finance
  engine.

## Examples

- `examples/kpi-model-summary-exhibit.md` — a fully worked exhibit spec for a real **FY model
  summary / KPI sheet**: every column's number-format mask, the input/formula/total cell-style map,
  a data-bar + icon-set + heatmap encoding (each with its non-colour cue and legend), a
  budget-vs-actual combo chart styled for integrity, and the print layout — copy the settings
  directly. Never lorem.

## References

- `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` — the Mission and Anti-Slop Charter; state the choice, prefer the
  authored exhibit over the default grid, sourcing-authority asymmetry.
- `doctrine/references/ai-slop-taxonomy.md` — the chart-junk / dashboard-decoration tells (3-D,
  rainbow scales, gauges) this skill rejects.
- `doctrine/references/wcag-2.2-criteria.md` — the accessibility floor: contrast 4.5:1 / 3:1, and
  never colour-alone (1.4.1) — the basis for the non-colour-cue rule on all conditional encoding.
- `doctrine/references/font-groups-and-usage.md` — the **04 Technical / Data** baseline faces with
  tabular lining figures for aligned numeric columns.
- `references/xlsx-design-system.md` — the number-format mask system, named cell/table styles, the
  blue-input/black-formula convention, and conditional-formatting-as-encoding (data bars / icon
  sets / colour scales) with non-colour cues.
- `references/exhibit-and-print-layout.md` — print area, fit-to-page legibility floor, centre-on-
  page, repeating headers, header/footer, greyscale-safe palette, tab colour-coding.
- **Sibling — `12-data-viz-and-dashboards/data-visualization`** owns the chart-choice + perceptual
  ranking + accessible-chart floor this skill *applies* inside Excel; defer encoding theory to it.
- **Defer to — finance engine** `C:\wamp64\www\chwezi-accounting-doctrine` (IFRS/IAS, statement
  structure, statutory/bookkeeping correctness) and the **engineering catalog** `~/.claude/skills`
  (spreadsheet engineering/automation) for **all formula / pivot / macro / model-calculation
  mechanics** — this skill is presentation-only.
