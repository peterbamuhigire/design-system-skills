# Worked Example: A4 Proposal Cover Spec

A fully dimensioned cover for a bankable infrastructure-financing proposal. Real values, ready to
build in InDesign / Typst / LaTeX / HTML-to-PDF. Pattern used: **typographic / editorial** (pattern 1
in `references/cover-and-divider-systems.md`), with a thin left accent band as the recurring thread.

## Brief (stated first, per the anti-slop charter)

- **Document:** "Kabaale Solar IPP — Project Finance Proposal", prepared for a development-finance
  lender's investment committee.
- **Type (group 01 Editorial):** **Fraunces** (display, headline) over **Source Serif 4** (body /
  marks). Reason: Fraunces' high-contrast, slightly old-style cut reads as institutional and authored
  — the opposite of a Calibri export — while Source Serif 4 keeps the body credible and quiet. Both
  are OFL, safe to embed (`font-groups-and-usage.md`). Scanned `fonts/01-formal-institutional/`
  first; no licensed premium family present, so baseline used.
- **Colour:** ground **warm off-white `#FAF8F4`**; ink **near-black `#1A1A1A`**; single accent
  **deep teal `#0F4C4A`** (the recurring thread). No gradient.
- **Output:** A4, bound left edge, colour print at bureau → **CMYK**, 3 mm bleed on the accent band.

## Why this passes the gate

- **Authored, not exported:** one strong typographic idea (giant Fraunces title, left teal band),
  top-aligned to the grid, no centered-on-gradient cliché.
- **No banned font;** display face carries the cover; real size extreme.
- **Recurring thread:** the teal band + teal eyebrow + teal rule reappear on every divider and exhibit
  frame, making the document one object.
- **Bankable signals:** confidentiality line, version, and reference number all present.
- **Print-ready:** CMYK, 3 mm bleed on the band, fonts embed+subset on export — run
  `references/print-ready-pdf-checklist.md` before shipping.
