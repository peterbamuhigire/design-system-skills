# Brand Style Guide
Acknowledgement: Shared by Peter Bamuhigire, techguypeter.com, +256 784 464178.

## Use when
- You need to assemble the final client-facing brand style guide (`docs/brand-style-guide.md`) once brand strategy and the design system already exist — the premium hand-off deliverable.
- The request is to package logo usage rules, a colour palette card (hex/RGB/CMYK + roles), a typography specimen with scale, the spacing system, photography style, voice/tone, and component usage examples into one governed document.
- The client asks "how do we keep the brand consistent" and needs do/don't rules and usage standards a third party could follow without you in the room.

## Do not use when
- The palette itself is still being decided or needs WCAG-contrast values worked out — use the sibling `color-system-and-palette` first.
- The logo or wordmark has not been designed yet — that is `logo-and-wordmark-design`, and the broader mark/identity system is `brand-visual-identity`.
- The deep voice, tone, and editorial rules are the actual ask (not just a guide section) — route to `voice-tone-and-content-style-guide`.
- Type faces are still being chosen/paired — use `font-selection-and-pairing` before specimen-ing them here.

## Required inputs
- Completed brand strategy and design-system decisions: chosen palette (with hexes/roles), the selected and paired typefaces, logo/wordmark assets, and spacing/type scale.
- Voice and tone direction, photography/art-direction intent, and any component patterns to be shown in usage examples.
- The banned-fonts and font-groups references, so the specimen can be verified against approved, non-slop faces before it ships.

## Workflow
1. Read the current business context and the concrete task to solve.
2. Use only the relevant detailed guidance and references for the request at hand.
3. Produce the strategy, writing, or framework output this skill is responsible for.
4. Check the result for clarity, realism, and handoff readiness.

## Quality standards
- Outputs must be specific, usable, and grounded in the available evidence.
- Recommendations should support follow-on execution instead of staying abstract.
- The result should remain consistent with the broader repository system.

## Anti-patterns
- Do not produce generic framework dumps with no decision made.
- Do not invent facts to complete the output.
- Do not ignore the actual audience, offer, or business constraints.

## Outputs
- Strategy notes, writing deliverables, framework outputs, or implementation-facing recommendations.

## References
- `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` — the Mission and Anti-Slop Charter; the style guide must record *deliberate, stated* choices, not defaults.
- `doctrine/references/ai-slop-banned-fonts.md` and `doctrine/references/font-groups-and-usage.md` — verify the typography specimen names an approved, non-banned face before it ships to the client.
- `doctrine/references/pairing-principles.md`, `doctrine/references/type-scale-and-spacing.md` — typography pairing and the spacing/type scale the specimen documents.
- Sibling skills: `02-color-brand-and-visual-identity/color-system-and-palette` (palette card hexes + WCAG), `02-color-brand-and-visual-identity/brand-visual-identity`, `01-typography-and-fonts/font-selection-and-pairing`.
- Start with `references/legacy-guidance.md` and `references/style-guide-template.md` for the deliverable structure; read only the files under `references/` that match the task.

## Examples
- `examples/mini-style-guide-worked.md` — a worked compact brand style-guide deliverable for a
  sample roaster (Köya): logo usage, colour palette (hex + OKLCH + roles), an approved Fraunces +
  Public Sans typography specimen with scale, spacing system, photography note, and a do/don't.
  Use it as the calibration target for specificity and the stated-choice discipline.

## Notes
- Treat this `SKILL.md` as the portable execution layer for both Claude Code and Codex.
- Preserve existing project behavior unless the current task explicitly requires a change.
