name: design-tokens-and-naming
description: Use when defining, naming, structuring, or exporting design tokens for ANY product that needs a single source of truth for colour, type, space, radius, elevation, or motion — a design system, a component library, a multi-brand or white-label platform, a dark-mode theme, or a Figma-to-code pipeline. Builds the three-tier token architecture (primitive → semantic → component), sets the naming convention, maps dark-mode and multi-brand semantic roles, and exports to CSS custom properties, JSON, and Style Dictionary. This is the backbone skill the rest of group 09 (component-library, dark-mode/theming, design-handoff) builds on — start here before authoring components or a handoff spec.

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- Standing up a new design system, or formalising an ad-hoc one, and you need named tokens
  instead of raw hexes/px scattered through code and Figma.
- Adding a second theme: dark mode, a high-contrast mode, a sub-brand, or a white-label tenant —
  anything that must reskin without rewriting components.
- Exporting tokens for engineering: CSS custom properties, JSON, Tailwind theme, iOS/Android,
  or a Style Dictionary build that fans out to all of those.
- Reviewing an existing token set that has drifted — duplicate hexes, components hardcoding
  primitives, names like `--blue-2` used as a semantic role.

## Do Not Use When

- You are still *choosing* the palette, ramp, or contrast pairs — do that first in
  `02-color-brand-and-visual-identity/color-system-and-palette` (it produces the perceptual ramp
  and the WCAG-gated pairs that become this skill's primitive colour tokens).
- You are designing the dark-mode *palette remap itself* (which hues lighten/desaturate) — that
  craft lives in `09-…/dark-mode-and-theming`; this skill only defines the *role names and tiers*
  it plugs into.
- You are authoring a component's variant/state matrix — that is
  `09-…/component-library-architecture`, which *consumes* the component-tier tokens defined here.
- The task is purely a type scale or spacing rhythm with no system to tokenise — use the
  doctrine references directly (`type-scale-and-spacing.md`).

## Required Inputs

- The resolved colour system (ramps + semantic intent + recorded WCAG results) from the colour
  skill, the type scale/ratio, and the spacing unit. Tokens *encode* these decisions — they do
  not invent them.
- Which themes must coexist now or soon (light, dark, brands/tenants, density modes). Decide the
  theme axes *before* naming, because they determine which tier carries the variation.
- Target export formats and platforms (web CSS, JSON, Style Dictionary, Tailwind, native).
- A naming-namespace prefix for the system/brand (e.g. `mdk` for Maduuka) to avoid collisions.

## Workflow

1. **Separate the three tiers before naming anything.** A token system that conflates them is the
   structural cause of drift.
   - **Primitive (a.k.a. global/option) tokens** — raw, context-free values: the full colour
     ramps, the type sizes, the space scale. Named by *what they are*, never *where they're used*:
     `color.blue.500`, `space.4`, `font.size.300`. Components must NEVER reference these directly.
   - **Semantic (a.k.a. alias/system) tokens** — role names that point *at* primitives and carry
     intent: `color.text.default`, `color.surface.raised`, `color.action.primary.bg`,
     `space.inset.md`. This is the only tier a theme (dark, brand) re-points. It is the contract.
   - **Component tokens** — the most specific tier, scoped to one component, pointing at semantic
     tokens: `button.primary.bg`, `card.padding`, `input.border.focus`. They exist so a single
     component can be retuned without touching the shared semantic layer.
   Each tier references *only the tier above it*: component → semantic → primitive → literal value.
   Never let a component reach past semantic to a primitive — that is the single most common
   failure and it silently breaks theming. See `references/token-tiers-and-naming.md`.

2. **Set one naming convention and hold it.** Use a consistent, hierarchical
   `namespace.category.concept.property.variant.state` shape (drop segments that don't apply),
   lower-kebab or dot-delimited, no abbreviations that aren't in a stated glossary. Decide
   plural-vs-singular, and decide your scale unit names (`100–900` numeric, or `xs…3xl` t-shirt)
   *once*. A name must say its tier: a reader should tell a primitive from a semantic token by
   the name alone. Banned names: anything that bakes a literal value into a role
   (`color.text.blue`), positional cruft (`color.box-2`), or a primitive masquerading as a role.

3. **Make semantic tokens the theming seam — never the primitives.** Light/dark, each brand, and
   each density mode are expressed by re-pointing the *semantic* layer at different primitives.
   Components and their tokens stay byte-identical across themes; only the alias targets change.
   This is what lets one component set serve N brands and both modes. For the dark remap, do NOT
   invert lightness — dark surfaces want lower chroma and a near-dark grey carrying the brand hue,
   accents usually lighten and slightly desaturate; re-run the contrast gate for the dark roles
   independently (doctrine colour rule; `02-…/color-system-and-palette` workflow). See
   `examples/semantic-mapping.md`.

4. **Encode colour primitives in OKLCH, not hex.** Author the ramps in OKLCH (`oklch(L C H)`):
   lightness is perceptual so ramp steps are *actually* even, hue stays put while you adjust
   chroma, and generating a dark variant or a sibling brand is a controlled L/C move rather than
   eyeballed hex-twiddling. Keep a hex fallback for legacy/email targets in the same token. This
   is the perceptual-uniformity rule from the colour system, carried into the token layer.

5. **Hold every themed semantic pair to the WCAG gate as a token-level invariant.** A token set is
   a *promise* that any sanctioned foreground/surface pairing passes: body/small text ≥ **4.5:1**,
   large text (≥24px or ≥18.66px bold) and meaningful UI/icons/focus ≥ **3:1**
   (`doctrine/references/wcag-2.2-criteria.md`, WCAG 1.4.3/1.4.11). Verify the pairs in *each*
   theme — light passing does not imply dark passing. Record the results next to the tokens; a
   token that can produce a failing pair is a bug, not a style choice.

6. **Tokenise type, space, radius, elevation, and motion too — not just colour.** Type sizes off
   a real ratio (≥1.25; doctrine `type-scale-and-spacing.md`), space as multiples of one unit
   (4 or 8px), a small radius set, an elevation set (shadow tokens that *also* remap for dark,
   where elevation reads as lighter surface + lower-chroma shadow), and motion duration/easing
   tokens. One rhythm, named once, is what separates "designed" from "assembled."

7. **Choose the export topology, then generate.** Single source of truth = the tier'd token file
   (JSON, ideally aligned to the **W3C Design Tokens** `$value`/`$type` format). Transform out to:
   CSS custom properties (semantic tokens become `:root` / `[data-theme="dark"]` / `[data-brand]`
   vars), a JSON consumed by app code, a Tailwind theme, and native platforms — via **Style
   Dictionary** so all targets derive from one source and cannot drift. See
   `references/token-export-formats.md` and `examples/tokens.json`.

8. **Document references, not values.** The handoff is the *semantic role map* and the alias graph,
   so engineering wires components to roles. A spec that lists hexes per component instead of role
   names has already lost the plot. Hand the wired tokens to
   `09-…/component-library-architecture` and `09-…/design-handoff-and-dev-spec`.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Two tiers, not three** — semantic tokens that *are* the primitives (`--blue-500` used as the
  button colour), so there is nothing to remap for a theme. The flat palette dumped from a tool,
  renamed, and called a token system.
- **Components reaching past the semantic layer** to a primitive (or a raw hex/px). Silently
  breaks dark mode and every brand. The #1 drift cause.
- **Names that encode the value or the position** (`color.text.blue`, `color.box-2`,
  `spacing-thing-3`) instead of the role/intent. A role named after a colour can't be re-themed.
- **Dark mode by lightness inversion**, full-chroma accents, `#000` surfaces, and shadows that
  don't remap — instead of a deliberate semantic re-point with re-checked contrast.
- **Hex-authored ramps** with perceptually uneven steps and muddy mid-tones, where deriving a
  dark or sibling-brand variant is guesswork — instead of OKLCH.
- **Per-platform hand-maintained copies** of the tokens that drift, instead of one source +
  Style Dictionary transforms.
- Treating the 4.5:1 / 3:1 gate as something to check once in light mode rather than a per-theme
  token invariant.

## Outputs

- A tier'd token file (primitive → semantic → component) in W3C-aligned JSON with OKLCH colour
  (+ hex fallback), a stated naming convention, the semantic role map with the dark and any
  brand remaps, recorded per-theme WCAG results, and generated exports (CSS custom properties,
  JSON, Style Dictionary config) plus a clean handoff to the component-library and handoff skills.

## Examples

- `examples/tokens.json` — a complete worked token set for a sample brand: OKLCH primitive ramps,
  semantic roles with a light + dark remap, and component tokens, in W3C `$value`/`$type` form.
- `examples/semantic-mapping.md` — the same system as a readable role-mapping table showing how
  one semantic layer re-points across light, dark, and a second brand, with the contrast results.
