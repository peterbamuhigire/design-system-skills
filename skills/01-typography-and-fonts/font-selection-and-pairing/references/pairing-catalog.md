# Reference: Pairing Catalog

Concrete, named display+body pairings by design-intent category. Every face is checked against
`doctrine/references/ai-slop-banned-fonts.md` and drawn from the approved baselines in
`doctrine/references/font-groups-and-usage.md`.

`pairing-principles.md` is the theory. This catalog is the menu. State the display face, body
face, category, and one-line reason before producing the artifact.

## 01 Formal / Institutional

| # | Display / Header | Body | Why it works |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Source Serif 4 700 | Public Sans 400 | Serious serif authority over a civic, quiet sans body; strong for formal proposals and statutory reports. |

| F3 | Crimson Pro 700 | Source Serif 4 400 | Formal all-serif register with enough contrast in structure and weight to avoid muddiness. |
| F4 | IBM Plex Serif 600 | IBM Plex Sans 400 | Engineered formal tone for technical reports, standards, governance packs, and SRS/BRD work. |

## 02 Editorial / Literary

| # | Display / Header | Body | Why it works |

| # | Display / Header | Body | Code / Data Accent | Why it works |

Space Grotesk, Instrument Serif, Poppins, Montserrat, Nunito/Nunito Sans, or Source Sans 3 as a
display/standalone face. Full reasons are in `doctrine/references/ai-slop-banned-fonts.md`.
