description: Use when designing or restructuring a landing page, marketing page, product home, waitlist/signup page, or campaign page where the goal is a single conversion (sign up, start trial, book a demo, buy, join the list). Covers the section architecture — hero with a sharp value proposition, proof and social proof, objection handling, a deliberate CTA hierarchy, and the closing ask — plus the conversion-CREDIBILITY craft that earns the click honestly. Forbids dark patterns (fake scarcity, confirmshaming, forced continuity, sneak-into-cart, disguised ads, hard-to-cancel) and the convergent SaaS-template look (Inter + indigo gradient + three-feature-icon row + hero-with-two-buttons). Run distinctive-by-design first; pair with trust-credibility-and-social-proof for the proof section.

## Use When

- You are building or rebuilding a **landing / marketing / product-home / campaign / waitlist**
  page whose success is measured by **one** conversion (signup, trial, demo, purchase, subscribe).
- A page exists but underperforms and you need to diagnose *why the visitor doesn't act* —
  unclear value prop, weak proof, buried CTA, friction, or a credibility gap.
- A growth/marketing team hands you copy and asks for the page structure and CTA hierarchy.
- You are asked to "make it convert" and your instinct (or someone else's) is reaching for
  countdown timers, fake "3 people are viewing this," or a pre-checked upsell — STOP and use the
  anti-dark-pattern rules here instead.

## Do Not Use When

- The page is a **product UI** (dashboard, app screen, settings) not a marketing page — use
  `practical-ui-design` / `webapp-gui-design`.
- The task is the **trust/proof section in isolation** — go to
  `trust-credibility-and-social-proof` (P1, group 04). This skill *composes* that section into the
  whole page; that skill details the testimonial/security-cue catalog.
- The task is a **multi-step checkout or signup flow** — use `ecommerce-and-checkout-ux` (P1,
  group 06) or `onboarding-and-first-run-design` (P1, group 04). A landing page *ends* at the CTA;
  those skills own what happens after the click.
- You only need the **copy/microcopy** for buttons and headlines — use
  `10-content-design-and-ux-writing/ux-writing-and-microcopy` for wording, then return here for
  placement and hierarchy.

## Required Inputs

- **The ONE action.** Exactly one primary conversion goal for the page. If there are two
  equally-weighted goals, the page has none — split it or rank them. Write it down first.
- **The audience and their stage.** Cold (never heard of you) vs warm (clicked an ad they already
  understand) changes how much proof and education the page must carry above the fold.
- **The real value proposition** — the genuine one-sentence answer to *"why should this specific
  person care, in their words, not yours."* Not a tagline; the concrete outcome. You cannot design
  a hero around a slogan you haven't sharpened (doctrine: design around real content, never lorem).
- **Real proof you are allowed to use** — named customers, real quotes with attribution, true
  metrics, genuine logos/certifications. If proof is thin, the page must be honest about it (see
  conversion-credibility), not fabricate it.

## Workflow

### 0. Run the pre-flight, then commit the page's ONE distinctive idea
Run `04-web-and-ui-design/distinctive-by-design` first — it gates the build. A landing page is the
single highest-stakes surface for the Mission: it is where the convergent SaaS template
(Inter / indigo gradient / glass cards / centred hero / three-feature-icon row) is most reflexive
and most damaging. Commit ONE authored organising idea for the page (a signature display face
carrying the headline, an off-centre hero, a recurring motif, an authored image POV) per
`doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §0 and `pairing-principles.md`. State it before any markup.

### 1. Lock the single conversion goal and the message match
- Name the **one** primary action. Every section below either moves the visitor toward it or earns
  the right to ask. Secondary actions (a "learn more", a docs link) are visually subordinate — a
  text link, never a second equal-weight button competing with the primary CTA.
- **Message match:** the hero headline must echo the promise of whatever brought the visitor here
  (the ad, the email subject, the search). A mismatch between the click's promise and the page's
  first line is the largest, most common conversion leak.

### 2. Build the section spine (see `references/landing-anatomy.md`)
Order is deliberate — it answers the visitor's questions in the sequence they ask them:

1. **Hero** — value prop headline + supporting subhead + primary CTA + one credibility anchor
   (a real proof token: named logo strip, a rating, a usage number). Answers *"what is this and is
   it for me?"* in one screen.
2. **Value proposition / outcome** — the concrete transformation, framed as the visitor's outcome,
   not your feature list. Answers *"what do I get?"*
3. **How it works / the mechanism** — enough to make the promise believable. Answers *"how?"*
4. **Social proof** — testimonials with attribution, case numbers, logos, ratings. Composed from
   `trust-credibility-and-social-proof`. Answers *"do people like me trust this?"*
5. **Objection handling** — address the top 2–3 real reasons this visitor hesitates (price, effort,
   risk, lock-in). A short FAQ or a comparison. Answers *"what's the catch?"*
6. **Closing CTA** — restate the value and the ask, with the same primary action. Answers
   *"okay — how do I start?"*

Not every page needs all six, but the *sequence* (claim → outcome → believability → proof →
objections → ask) is the load-bearing logic. Reorder only with a stated reason.

### 3. Design the CTA hierarchy
- **One primary CTA**, repeated (hero + closing, sometimes a sticky bar) but *visually identical*
  every time — same label, same weight, same colour role. Repetition without variation; the
  visitor learns the button.
- **Real button copy** stating the value, not the mechanic: "Start my free trial" / "Get the audit"
  — not "Submit" / "Click here." (Route wording through `ux-writing-and-microcopy`.)
- **One focal point per screen.** The primary CTA is the brightest, highest-contrast element in its
  viewport. If a secondary action is equally loud, demote it (`distinctive-by-design` §3 — one
  clear focal point, designed eye-path).
- **Minimise the ask.** The fewest fields the conversion truly needs. Every extra field is friction;
  defer the rest to after the click (see `onboarding-and-first-run-design`).

### 4. Earn the click — conversion-credibility, not coercion (see `references/conversion-credibility.md`)
This is the heart of the skill and the doctrine's ethics line. Persuasion is legitimate; coercion
and deception are not. Build conversion from **honest** levers:

- **Specificity over hype** — a true number ("cuts month-end close from 9 days to 2") out-converts
  a superlative ("revolutionary platform") and survives scrutiny.
- **Real, attributable proof** — named person, role, company, ideally a face. Anonymous "★★★★★ —
  a happy customer" reads as fabricated and *lowers* trust.
- **Risk reversal, stated plainly** — a real guarantee, a genuine free tier, "no card required" only
  if it is actually true. Honest risk reversal is the strongest ethical conversion lever there is.
- **Transparent pricing and terms** — show the price, the renewal, the cancellation path. Hiding
  them converts the wrong people and they churn or chargeback.

**Banned — dark patterns (never ship these, even if asked):** fake/urgency-faked countdowns and
"only 2 left" that reset on reload; "3 people are viewing this right now" invented numbers;
confirmshaming opt-outs ("No thanks, I hate saving money"); pre-checked add-ons / opt-ins;
sneak-into-basket; forced continuity (free trial that auto-charges with no reminder and a buried
cancel); disguised ads and fake "system" notifications; roach-motel signup (one click in, ten to
leave). These violate `doctrine/design-doctrine.md` §0 (looking *authored and trustworthy*) and the
engine's ethics posture. If a stakeholder requests one, refuse and offer the honest equivalent
(see `references/conversion-credibility.md` §Dark-pattern → honest-swap table).

### 5. Hold the line on accessibility and performance — they ARE conversion
- **Accessibility (`doctrine/references/wcag-2.2-criteria.md`):** the CTA must be a real focusable
  control with a visible focus ring; target size ≥ 24×24px (SC 2.5.8); contrast ≥ the criterion for
  button text; never colour-only state. An inaccessible CTA is an un-clickable CTA for some visitors
  — a direct conversion loss, not just a compliance line.
- **Performance (`doctrine/references/web-performance-budgets-2026.md`):** the hero is the LCP
  element — keep it light; a slow first screen is abandoned before the value prop is read. Reserve
  space for hero media to protect CLS; defer below-the-fold weight. Treat the LCP/INP/CLS budgets as
  design constraints, not after-thoughts.

### 6. Specify, then build
Produce a section-by-section spec (see `examples/landing-wireframe-spec.md` for the shape): per
section — purpose, the real content, the type/weight/space treatment, the focal point, the CTA
state, and the proof token. Run the checklist below before any markup.

## Conversion-Credibility Checklist (run before building)

1. **One conversion goal** named; secondary actions visually subordinate (never a second equal CTA).
2. **Message match** — hero headline echoes the click's promise.
3. **Value prop is a concrete outcome in the visitor's words**, sharpened from real content — not a
   slogan, not lorem.
4. **Section spine present and in believable order** — claim → outcome → mechanism → proof →
   objections → ask (deviations have a stated reason).
5. **CTA hierarchy** — identical repeated primary CTA, value-stating copy, single focal point per
   screen, minimal fields.
6. **All proof is real and attributable** — named people/companies/numbers; zero fabricated
   testimonials, logos, or metrics.
7. **Zero dark patterns** — no fake scarcity/urgency, confirmshaming, pre-checked opt-ins, forced
   continuity, sneak-into-cart, disguised ads, roach-motel.
8. **Risk reversal and pricing/terms are honest and visible** when claimed.
9. **CTA passes WCAG 2.2** — focusable, visible focus, ≥24px target, sufficient contrast, not
   colour-only.
10. **Hero respects the performance budget** — LCP-light, CLS-reserved.
11. **No convergent default** — type/colour/layout pass `distinctive-by-design` (no Inter+indigo
    gradient, no three-feature-icon row as a reflex, no centred-everything).

If any item can't be satisfied (proof is thin, a stakeholder insists on a dark pattern, no real
copy yet), **say so and ask** — never quietly ship the coercive or convergent version.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Two co-equal CTAs** in the hero ("Start free" *and* "Contact sales" at identical weight) —
  the choice paralyses; rank them.
- **Feature-listing instead of outcome-selling** — a wall of "we have X, Y, Z" with no "so you can…"
- **The convergent SaaS template** — Inter/Geist, indigo→blue gradient, glass cards, centred hero
  with two buttons, the three-feature-icon row, a logo strip with no real names. The single most
  template-looking surface on the web; the Mission targets it directly.
- **Fabricated or anonymous proof** — stock-photo "customers," "★★★★★ — Anonymous," logos of
  companies that aren't actually customers. Lowers trust and is dishonest.
- **Dark patterns of any kind** (see §4 banned list) — they convert the wrong people, invite
  chargebacks and churn, and violate the engine's ethics. Non-negotiable.
- **Friction the conversion doesn't need** — a 9-field form for a newsletter; demanding a card for a
  "free" trial without saying so up front.
- **Burying the ask** — the only CTA below three screens of scroll, or low-contrast against its
  background.
- **Ignoring message match** — a beautiful page that answers a different question than the ad asked.

## Outputs

- A **stated page conversion goal** and the committed distinctive idea (what + why + human
  authority), written before markup.
- A **section-by-section spec** (purpose, real content, type/space treatment, focal point, CTA
  state, proof token per section) in the shape of `examples/landing-wireframe-spec.md`.
- A **CTA hierarchy** definition and a **completed conversion-credibility checklist** confirming
  zero dark patterns and real, attributable proof.

## Examples

- `examples/landing-wireframe-spec.md` — a full, real section-by-section landing spec for a sample
  product (an SMB month-end-close tool), showing hero through closing CTA, the CTA hierarchy, the
  honest-proof treatment, and the WCAG/perf constraints applied.
