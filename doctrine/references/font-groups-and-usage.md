# Reference: Font Categories, Usage, and Approved Baselines

Font routing is based on design intent, not only artifact type. Each category maps to a folder
in `fonts/<category>/` and to a family of visual voices. Before committing, scan the matching
folder for present premium files and read its `MANIFEST.md`.

The eight top-level category folder names are fixed team taxonomy. On a new device, or after
pulling a font-taxonomy change, create or verify these folders before adding files or scanning.
Individual font selections may differ by device; category names must not.

> Pairing always crosses a display/header face with a refined body face. A category tells you
> the voice and role; `pairing-principles.md` tells you how to combine faces.

## Guardrails

- Never use banned primary faces from `ai-slop-banned-fonts.md`.
- Never use a script/cursive face for body text.
- Never let body workhorses become a monotype identity.
- Never place Geist in any folder; it is banned.
- State the chosen display + body pair and reason before producing output.
