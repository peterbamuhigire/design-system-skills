# AGENTS.md — design-system-skills

## Codex-only model setup and Kaizen review

Apply this section only when the active runner is Codex. Claude and other
runners must skip it and retain their own models and full engine capabilities.

Before substantive Codex work, resolve this engine's directory and an available
Python 3.11+ interpreter (use its absolute path if absent from PATH), then run
`python <engine-root>/.codex/ensure_model_policy.py --runtime codex --check`.
If it reports configuration drift, Peter authorises the bounded
`--runtime codex --apply` repair, followed by `--check`. The helper backs up
changes and preserves unrelated settings. If Python or configuration access is
unavailable, report the limitation; do not replace the user's config wholesale.
Read `.codex/model-policy.md` for the full contract. Use Astra (`gpt-6-astra`)
for the root/orchestrator and reviewer; explicitly pin execution subagents to
Luna (`gpt-5.6-luna`). Delegate bounded work when useful and keep final review
with Astra. A running session may need restarting for root settings to apply.

Every Kaizen cycle MUST check latest official model releases and actual
runtime availability, record dated evidence and a retain/change decision,
and evaluate better candidates before recommending replacement. Preserve the
pins until Peter authorises a verified change. Missing model-currentness
evidence is `NOT_ASSESSED`. This Codex adapter must not change CLAUDE.md,
Claude configuration, domain doctrine, permission settings or skill access.

## Universal agent integration

See `.skills-engine/engine-manifest.yaml` for the declarative contract used by the optional universal coordination package. The router and domain SKILL.md files remain authoritative.

The package may read the router, discover skills, inspect Git, and run only declared checks. Missing evidence is NOT ASSESSED; writes, pulls, publication, submissions, ledger/filing changes, deployment, or control changes require explicit approval.

## Never store book extractions

Book extractions, book summaries and chapter-by-chapter notes must never be stored in this
repository (no `book-extractions/` or `docs/book-study/` folder, no `*-extraction.md` files). Keeping them infringes
copyright. Knowledge from purchased books enters only as paraphrased, task-oriented skill content
and `references/` files (procedures, checklists, decision rules, templates) with a short citation
(Author (Year) *Title*, Publisher). Verbatim quotations stay rare and under 25 words. Staging
notes live outside the repository and are never linked from skills. `scripts/validate_engine.py`
fails if an extraction folder exists or a file under skills/, doctrine/ or docs/ links to one; plan and audit documents may name books but not store their content.

## References are task guides, not book digests

A `references/` file must be organised around the task it supports (inputs, decision rules,
procedures, pattern tables, original worked examples) and should synthesise more than one source
where more than one exists. It must not be a single-book digest: no chapter-numbered headings, no
catalogue reproduced in a book's own sequence, no book examples or case studies, no "key mantras"
lists, and no more than one brief attributed quotation. Cite sources in a short line (Author,
*Title*). Replace book examples with original, preferably localised, examples.

## Rules

Always-on cross-cutting principles live in `rules/` — see `rules/README.md`.
Load `rules/common/core.md` alongside the routed skill for any non-trivial task;
it is short and does not replace the skill, only sets the baseline the skill
operates within.

## Mandatory Digital Research currentness gate for Kaizen

Every Kaizen audit, skill edit, reference update, validator change, and
standardisation decision MUST begin with the Digital Research Engine at
`C:\wamp64\www\digital-research-engine`. Read its `source-evaluation` and
`source-verification` skills and the currentness gate reference
`docs/continuous-improvement/kaizen-currentness-gate.md`.

Before admitting any standard, policy, law, technology, platform capability,
software version, command, security control, benchmark, or lifecycle claim,
record source scope, publication/version date, access date, freshness class,
review date, support status, and uncertainty. Use current authoritative
primary sources; quarantine stale/ambiguous/unsupported claims and mark them
`NOT_ASSESSED`. Books are durable concept inputs only.

The shared control plane is adapted to visual and document work in
[`docs/control-plane-adoption.md`](docs/control-plane-adoption.md); the central
registry is `C:\wamp64\www\chwezi-dev-engine\docs\engine-control-plane.json`.

Cross-cutting design & typography engine. Compatible with Claude Code and Codex-style agents.
Extends the guidance in `CLAUDE.md` with runner-neutral operations and the Codex adapter, kept for dual-compat tooling.

## Protocol

1. **Entry:** read `doctrine/design-doctrine.md`.
2. **Select:** glob `skills/**/SKILL.md` **fresh every time** and route by frontmatter
   `description` (the filesystem is the index — never a cached list; this is how new skills are
   picked up with zero registration). The README table is a hint only. Do not use a `Skill`
   tool — read the files directly.
3. **Apply:** follow the `doctrine/references/` rules the skill cites.
4. **Gate:** before declaring an artifact done, run `governance/design-quality-gate.md`.

For skill creation, normalisation, or review, also read
`governance/skill-authoring-standard.md`. Run the local validator and routing smoke test after
any skill, frontmatter, router, doctrine, or governance change.

## Hard rules

- No banned AI-slop fonts as primary type (`doctrine/references/ai-slop-banned-fonts.md`).
- Always state typeface + reason before producing output.
- Always pair (display + body); use weight/size extremes; check licence before embedding.
- On a new device or after pulling font-taxonomy changes, ensure the eight required
  `fonts/<category>/` directories exist before scanning or adding files. The category names are
  fixed team contract; individual font choices inside them may differ by device.
- Premium font binaries are gitignored — scan `fonts/<category>/`, read its `MANIFEST.md`, fall
  back to the named OFL baseline when a premium family is absent or its licence does not permit
  the intended use.

## Relationship to other engines

Referenced, not mirrored. Domain engines consult this one IN ADDITION to their own work for any
presentation-layer concern. See `integration/integration-plan.md`.

## Skill-engine release commands

For visual changes, validate the machine-readable delivery record with
`python -X utf8 scripts/validate_design_delivery_evidence.py tests/fixtures/design-delivery/manifest.json`;
missing renders or required checks block a `PASS` verdict.

```powershell
python -X utf8 scripts/validate_engine.py --baseline tests/quality-baseline.json
python -X utf8 scripts/routing_smoke_test.py
```

The baseline is zero-debt: all 101 active skills currently pass the local contract. The validator
derives the active count from `skills/**/SKILL.md`; any new finding is a CI regression and must be
fixed before release.

When the sibling-engine workspace is available, also inspect declared external handoffs with
`python -X utf8 scripts/validate_cross_engine_routes.py --workspace-root <workspace-parent>`.
Missing sibling repositories are reported as `NOT ASSESSED`, not as a pass; the local route gate
remains independently runnable from this repository.

## DOMAIN PROMPT GENERATION CONTRACT

For a prompt handoff, read the local [domain prompt contract](docs/ai-prompting/domain-prompt-compilation-contract.md). Generate a ready-to-paste visual prompt with audience/job, real content, visual thesis, hierarchy, composition, typeface and reason, colour, states, accessibility, licensing, output, and render checks. **Ready-to-paste prompt:** include assumptions, asset/accessibility risks, and next action. **Failure action:** correct one perceptual defect or rebuild when the visual system is wrong.

## PORTFOLIO CRAFT CONTRACT

Load `C:\wamp64\www\chwezi-engine-agents\docs\operations\portfolio-craft-standard-2026-09-04.md` when available. Design in perceptible slices: frame the user job and visual thesis, choose one component or flow, inspect the surrounding system and real content, make one purposeful change, render it in context, check hierarchy, states, contrast, motion, input, and responsive behaviour, refine, and record the visual proof. Every typeface, colour, spacing, asset, radius, shadow, and animation needs a product reason; remove decorative defaults. Do not generate a complete polished-looking system without reviewing its actual screens or artefacts. Apply `Observe -> Baseline -> Select -> Experiment -> Check -> Standardise -> Teach -> Re-measure` to kaizen itself. Missing render, device, accessibility, content, or reviewer evidence is `NOT ASSESSED`, never a pass.
